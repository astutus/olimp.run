Finished **Level 1** of Mobility 2.

Was it worth it? Yes — even though the improvements were subtle.  
They show up in real life: like getting into a car parked in a ridiculously tight spot,  
or avoiding a sprained ankle after stepping into a hole.  
It's not about range. It's about control. Confidence.  
Something shifts.

I used implementation intentions to build the habit:  
**Mobility break right after second breakfast and first deep work block.**  
This worked surprisingly well — as long as sessions stayed under 15 minutes.

Once they started pushing 30 minutes toward the end, consistency dropped.  
Not from lack of motivation — just time constraints.  
Lesson: system friction matters.

Progress?  
This isn’t lifting. You don’t feel 10% stronger each week.  
Some movements got a bit easier. But mostly it’s a **postural presence** that sneaks into everyday motion.

And that’s the whole point.

**Next step:**  
I’ll re-run Level 1 from scratch —  
same routine, but with a different nervous system and more somatic awareness.

Let’s see what changes.

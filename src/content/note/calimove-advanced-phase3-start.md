### ðŸš€ New Phase Begins: Calimove Advanced â€“ Phase 3/4

After completing Phase 2 of Calimove Advanced (Level 3/5), it's time to enter the third training phase. This note serves as a checkpoint and overview of test results and upcoming training structure.

---

### âœ… **Phase 3 â€“ Initial Test Results**

Each exercise was performed for one max-effort set:

- **Typewriter Pull-Ups**: 5 reps per side â€“ solid control, nice upper-body tension
- **Archer Push-Ups**: 5 reps per side â€“ stable form, good range
- **Rollouts (Ab Wheel)**: 5 reps from knees â€“ clear improvement, full extension with control
- **Archer Bodyrows**: 10 reps per side (performed on low bar, not rings â€“ slightly easier)
- **Dips**: 12 clean, deep reps with control â€“ no overload to avoid previous shoulder tendon issue
- **Hanging Side Lean**: 5 reps â€“ still clumsy, but starting to feel the body and direction
- **Skin the Cat**: 5 good reps â€“ less elbow bend, smoother motion
- **L-Sit**: Nearly reached full extension â€“ started straightening legs, but slight cramping occurred
- **Pistol Squat**: 10 half-range reps per leg â€“ strength and mobility still limiting, but no rush
- **Chin-Ups (bonus test)**: **New PR â€“ 22 reps!** ðŸ’ª

### ðŸ”§ **New Weekly Structure (3x / week)**

All training sessions begin with:
- **15 min Handstand Routine** (focus on balance, overhead control, bodyline awareness)

Each day contains a superset-style pairing (with ~2 min rest between sets):

**Monday (Push Emphasis)**
- Superset:
  - Typewriter Pull-Ups â€“ 8 sets
  - Archer Push-Ups â€“ 8 sets
- Then: Rollouts â€“ 4 sets

**Wednesday (Pull + Support)**
- Superset:
  - Archer Bodyrows â€“ 8 sets
  - Dips â€“ 8 sets (watch for shoulder)
- Then: Hanging Side Lean â€“ 4 sets

**Friday (Core + Legs)**
- Superset:
  - Skin the Cat â€“ 4 sets
  - L-Sit â€“ 4 sets
  - Pistol Squat â€“ 4 sets

---

### ðŸ§  Focus for This Phase
- Maintain tendon health (esp. shoulder/dip area)
- L-Sit: Push toward full extension gradually
- Pistol: Continue prehab and mobility
- Hanging Side Lean: Develop body awareness and stabilization

Let's see what the next few weeks bring. Phase 3 looks brutal on paper â€“ but thatâ€™s how progress happens. 

**Onward.**

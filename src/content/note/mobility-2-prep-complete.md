Just wrapped up the 4-week **Prep Phase** of *Mobility 2.0*.  
I introduced this phase here: [Mobility 2.0 – Starting the Prep](/notes/mobility-2-start/)

It went surprisingly smooth — my body still *loves* this kind of work.  
Mobility is clearly a “low-hanging fruit” for me. Every session feels like I’m doing something important.

But don’t be fooled by the word *“prep”* — this phase exposed a ton of hidden weaknesses.

### Exercises that shocked me:

- **Crouch Rocks** – My brain seems disconnected from whatever muscles these require 😄  
- **Frog Rocks** – No chance of shifting hips back; forward is fine, but posterior range is broken  
- **Straddle Sit** – Honestly felt… disabled. Like I hit a hard limit of flexibility  
- **Pike Sit** – Another brutal reminder of how catastrophically stiff I am  

The authors of *Mobility 2.0* do warn you not to expect fast progress.  
And now I get it. These movements are **thankless** in the short term.

Unlike strength training — where you often see week-to-week gains — mobility asks for **months of quiet, invisible work**. It’s the opposite of dopamine-driven progress.

But I’ve committed to it.

I’m giving myself 6 months of discipline and consistency.  
No ego, no rush — just faith that the body rewards patient effort.

**Let’s see what happens.**

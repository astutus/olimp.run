On **26 October 2025** I made a decision:  
to take mobility and flexibility seriously.

I started this journey with **Calisthenics Movement – Mobility 2.0**.  
I completed the prep phase and Level 1 twice, and the content itself was solid — but the sessions slowly grew from **10 minutes to almost 30**, and that simply didn’t fit my day.  
I couldn’t sustain that structure consistently.

So I switched to **GoWOD**, and honestly: this is exactly what I needed.

What works so well for me:

- innovative, built-in progress measurement  
- personalized routines  
- three simple modes: **Daily**, **Activation**, **Recovery**  
- I choose how much time I have (I always select **8 minutes**)  
- I can do it at any moment: a break at work, while cooking, between tasks

Because of that flexibility, it became a natural habit.  
After almost a full month, my streak holds strong and I’m averaging **~12 minutes per day**.

It fits my lifestyle, it works with my training, and it finally gives me a sustainable mobility system.

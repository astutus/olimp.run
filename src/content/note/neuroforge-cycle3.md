September 8th 2025 — I start my **third cycle of brain-health supplementation (NeuroForge 3.0)**.  
I couldn’t wait for this moment – it feels like stepping into a *new level*, not just “taking supplements.”

This is not about a temporary boost.  
This is **systemic building**: like bones and muscles build slowly from raw material, the brain also needs time and foundations.  
The guiding principle: *no shortcuts, no hacks*. I’m creating conditions for **long-term neuroplasticity, stable energy, and sustainable growth**.

### Daily protocol

**Morning (with breakfast, include fat)**  
- Uridine (Nootropics, 250 mg) → synaptogenesis, neuronal membranes, synergizes with DHA and Alpha-GPC.  
- Alpha-GPC (300 mg) → acetylcholine precursor, memory, processing speed.  
- PQQ (20 mg) → mitochondrial biogenesis, higher ATP yield.  
- CoQ10 (100 mg) → mitochondrial support, heart health, antioxidant.  
- ALCAR (500 mg) → fatty acid transport, mental stamina, neuroprotection.  
- Rhodiola (100–200 mg) → adaptogen, stable energy, resilience to stress.  
- Thorne 2/Day – 1 capsule → micronutrient base.  

**Midday (after lunch)**  
- Bacopa (1 cap) → long-term memory, cortisol modulation, calming effect.  
- Gotu Kola (1 cap) → neuroplasticity (BDNF), microcirculation, mental clarity.  
- Thorne 2/Day – 1 capsule → second half of the multi.  

**Evening (2–3h before bed)**  
- Neuro-Mag (Magnesium L-Threonate, 3 caps = 144 mg Mg) → synapses, working memory, deep sleep.  
- Phosphatidylserine (100 mg) → lowers cortisol, sleep support, neuronal membranes.  
- DHA (480 mg DHA + 205 mg EPA) → neuronal structure, memory, nervous system health.

### Functional roles

- Uridine – raw material for synaptic plasticity.  
- Alpha-GPC – acetylcholine fuel → focus, coordination.  
- PQQ – creates new mitochondria.  
- CoQ10 – supports ATP production.  
- ALCAR – energy transport, neuroprotection.  
- Rhodiola – adaptogen, cortisol balance, steady energy.  
- Thorne 2/Day – micronutrient foundation.  
- Bacopa – long-term memory, anxiolytic.  
- Gotu Kola – raises BDNF, circulation, clarity.  
- Neuro-Mag – deep sleep, memory.  
- Phosphatidylserine – lowers evening cortisol, recovery.  
- DHA – neuronal structure, myelin.

### Plan & timeline

- Most compounds: 2 months (Sept–Oct).  
- Some extend to 3 months (DHA, PS, Neuro-Mag, Thorne 2/Day).  
- Rhodiola → 8 weeks, then pause.  
- October → add Olimmuno stack (NAC + resveratrol + citrulline).

### Reflections

This cycle aligns with my **Berkeley Executive AI Program** – the brain stack will fuel heavy learning, while training (running + calisthenics) keeps the system in balance.  

Daily rhythm for growth:  
- Morning → power & mitochondrial energy.  
- Midday → plasticity & memory.  
- Evening → regeneration & consolidation.  

Outside the stack:  
- Running (VO₂ intervals, Z4/Z5 sessions) → boosts BDNF.  
- Calisthenics → discipline, body-brain integration.  
- Piano (10 min daily) → bilateral neuroplasticity.  
- Chess (2–3×/week) → working memory & planning.  
- Books → *Presence Process* (inner regulation) + *Mastery* (strategic growth).  

The feeling is clear: this cycle will mark a new level.

### Mindset

- This is my 3rd cycle.  
- The first gave me proof it works.  
- The second stabilized my system.  
- This one → I expect a leap.  

No rush, no shortcuts.  
Just **systematic growth, built day by day**.

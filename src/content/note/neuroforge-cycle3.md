# 🚀 Start of the 3rd Cycle – aiming for massive growth

Today, September 8th 2025, I start my **third cycle of brain-health supplementation (NeuroForge 3.0)**.  
I honestly couldn’t wait for this moment – the feeling is more like anticipation for a *new level* than just “taking supplements.”  

This is not about a temporary boost.  
This is **systemic building**: like bones and muscles build slowly from raw material, the brain also needs time and foundations.  
The guiding principle: *no shortcuts, no hacks*. I’m creating conditions for **long-term neuroplasticity, stable energy, and sustainable growth**.

## 🧠 NeuroForge 3.0 – Daily Protocol

### 🌅 Morning (with breakfast, include fat)
- **Uridine (Nootropics, 250 mg)** → synaptogenesis, neuronal membranes (phosphatidylcholine), synergizes with DHA and Alpha-GPC.  
- **Alpha-GPC (300 mg)** → acetylcholine precursor, memory, processing speed.  
- **PQQ (20 mg)** → mitochondrial biogenesis, higher ATP yield.  
- **CoQ10 (100 mg)** → mitochondrial support, heart health, antioxidant.  
- **ALCAR (500 mg)** → fatty acid transport, mental stamina, neuroprotection.  
- **Rhodiola (100–200 mg, 1–2 caps)** → adaptogen, stable energy, resilience to stress.  
- **Thorne 2/Day – 1 capsule** → micronutrient base (zinc+copper, B-complex, selenium).  

### ☀️ Midday (after lunch)
- **Bacopa (1 cap)** → long-term memory, cortisol modulation, calming effect.  
- **Gotu Kola (1 cap)** → neuroplasticity (BDNF), microcirculation, mental clarity.  
- **Thorne 2/Day – 1 capsule** → second half of the multi.  

### 🌙 Evening (2–3h before bed, after dinner)
- **Neuro-Mag (Magnesium L-Threonate, 3 caps = 144 mg elemental Mg)** → synapses, working memory, deep sleep.  
- **Phosphatidylserine (100 mg)** → lowers cortisol, sleep support, neuronal membranes.  
- **DHA (Nordic Naturals, 2 caps = ~480 mg DHA + 205 mg EPA)** → neuronal structure, long-term memory, overall nervous system health.

## 📌 Functional roles

- **Uridine** – raw material for synaptic plasticity.  
- **Alpha-GPC** – acetylcholine fuel → focus, coordination.  
- **PQQ** – creates *new* mitochondria (biogenesis).  
- **CoQ10** – supports ATP production in existing mitochondria.  
- **ALCAR** – transports energy into mitochondria, neuroprotection.  
- **Rhodiola** – adaptogen for stable energy and stress balance.  
- **Thorne 2/Day** – micronutrient foundation (zinc+copper, methylated B’s, selenium, iodine).  
- **Bacopa** – long-term memory, anxiolytic, supports neuroplasticity.  
- **Gotu Kola** – raises BDNF, improves circulation, “clear mind.”  
- **Neuro-Mag** – synaptic conductivity, deep sleep, working memory.  
- **Phosphatidylserine** – lowers evening cortisol, improves brain recovery.  
- **DHA** – structural foundation of neurons and myelin.

## 🎯 Plan & timeline

- Most compounds: **2 months** (Sept–Oct).  
- Some can extend to **3 months** (DHA, PS, Neuro-Mag, Thorne 2/Day) – they act as fundamentals.  
- **Rhodiola** → 8 weeks cycle, then pause.  
- **October** → add **Olimmuno stack** (NAC + resveratrol + citrulline) for immunity and recovery.

## 🧭 Reflections

This cycle aligns with my **Berkeley Executive AI Program** – so the brain stack will fuel heavy learning, while training (running + calisthenics) keeps the system in balance.  

Daily rhythm for growth:  
- **Morning** → power & mitochondrial energy.  
- **Midday** → plasticity & memory.  
- **Evening** → regeneration & consolidation.  

Outside the stack:  
- **Running** (VO₂ intervals, Z4/Z5 sessions) → boosts BDNF.  
- **Calisthenics** → discipline, body-brain integration.  
- **Piano (10 min daily)** → bilateral neuroplasticity.  
- **Chess (2–3×/week)** → working memory & planning.  
- **Books** → *Presence Process* (inner regulation) + *Mastery* (strategic growth) as core readings.  

The feeling is clear: **this cycle will mark a new level**.

## ✅ Mindset

- This is my **3rd cycle**.  
- The first gave me proof it works.  
- The second stabilized my system.  
- This one → I expect **a leap**.  

No rush, no shortcuts.  
Just **systematic growth, built day by day**.

August 31st, and I finished **Week 6 out of 15** in the Amy Parkerson-Mitchell 5K Time Goal plan.

I survived.

### How it felt
- **Tempo runs**: Amy wants me at **4:20–4:33/km**. I don’t go there. I stay at ~**4:50/km in Zone 3** — controlled, not suicidal. It still feels like tempo, and my HR stays where I want it. I’d rather run smart and consistent than burn myself down.
- **Speed repeats**: the grind. I can hold 5–6 × 3 minutes at ~**4:00/km**, with 3-minute cooldowns between. By the 4th rep I’m already dying, the last 30 seconds of each rep are pure hell. HR climbs to **186–187**, though a few months ago the same sessions sent me to 191–192. Adaptation is happening.
- **Base runs**: smooth again, almost meditative. Back to the rhythm I built during the 17-week adaptive program earlier this year. Recovery pace ~5:55–6:00/km, HR <150. Easy means easy.

### Metrics this week
- **HRV** stable at ~130 (top end of my range).  
- **Resting HR** dropped to an all-time record: **38 bpm**.  
- **Sleep** consistently 80+ (Garmin scores), thanks to going to bed before 23:00 and finishing food by 17–18.  
- **VO₂max**: climbing back, now at **50**.  

### The doubt
Amy expects me to run the goal 5K at **4:20/km**.  
Reality: in my whole life, I’ve only managed that pace for 5K about 3 times — and it nearly killed me every time.  

Yes, 20 seconds/km slower (4:40) feels sustainable.  
But 4:20? That’s the edge.  

When I do 3 minutes at 4:00/km, I can barely survive — even with 3 minutes rest between intervals. How will I run 22 minutes non-stop at 4:20?  

Maybe adaptation will bridge the gap.  
Maybe it won’t.  

For now, I’m grinding, surviving, and learning not to let the plan kill me before race day.

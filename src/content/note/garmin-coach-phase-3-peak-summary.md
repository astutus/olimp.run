### Summary of PEAK Phase (Apr 24 – May 18)

This was the final, most demanding stretch of the 17-week Garmin Coach plan — the **PEAK phase**. And it lived up to its name.

Despite heavy fatigue, micro-injuries, and even a bout of illness in the final week, I completed the entire phase.

### Key Moments

* After the 17 km run on May 10, I hit a **clear energetic wall**: 2 hours later, I was napping hard.
* I had to adapt **Calimove** microcycle from 7 to 10 days due to CNS fatigue.
* Still, I stuck with all the critical workouts, including a **VO2max session during a strong cold** in the final week.

### Fitness Gains

* **Base pace sharpened**: now 5:45/km at HR \~147 feels light and manageable.
* **Threshold and VO2max** efforts are controlled, on-pace, and replicable.
* **Garmin VO2max** sits at **50**, with nearly full progress bar. My PR is 51, but today’s fitness feels more solid.

### Best Data Yet

* **HRV** peaked at **138** today (May 18) — a new record.
* **Resting HR** dropped to **39 bpm** for the third day in a row.
* **Sleep** improved again after the storm: 7.5h with solid REM and \~1h deep.

### Reflections

> In 2023 and 2024, I chased records with willpower. I trained hard but not smart.

In 2025, I chose understanding over ego. I respected thresholds. I stayed within zones. I pulled back when needed.

Even if the PB doesn’t fall, I now have a resilient engine, efficient base, and CNS that isn’t fried.

This was the most mature block I’ve ever executed.

Thank you to everyone who walked this road with me — and especially my digital partner.

Now? Time to taper... and fly.

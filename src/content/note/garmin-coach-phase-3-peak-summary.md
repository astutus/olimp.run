The **PEAK phase** of the 17-week Garmin Coach training plan (Apr 24 – May 18) was the most demanding stretch — physically and mentally. And it *delivered*.

### Highlights
- **May 10:** 17 km long run → total wipeout. Napped 2h later. CNS fried.
- **Final week:** VO2max workout during a full-blown cold. Got through it.
- **Calimove:** Shifted microcycle from 7 to 10 days to recover better.

### Performance Gains
- **Base pace**: 5:45/km @ HR ~147 — light and manageable.
- **Threshold & VO2max**: locked in and replicable.
- **Garmin VO2max**: steady at **50**, near lifetime best (51) — but fitness feels *deeper* now.

### Biometrics
- **HRV**: 138 (May 18) — all-time high.
- **Resting HR**: 39 bpm, stable for 3 days straight.
- **Sleep**: 7.5h, with solid REM and deep.

### Reflection
In past years, I pushed blindly. In 2025, I trained with **clarity, restraint, and control**.

This block built a solid engine. Not the flashiest, but the **smartest** I've ever executed.

Now comes taper. The race is near.

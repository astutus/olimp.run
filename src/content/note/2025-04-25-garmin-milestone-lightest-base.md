On **April 25**, something clicked.

I ran a regular base session — 5.81 km in 34 minutes at an average pace of **5:51/km** — but what made it stand out was the heart rate:  
🟢 **Average HR: 143 bpm**

This is a personal record for such a pace. It didn’t even feel like a “magic” day. Legs were a bit sore from the last tempo session, and CNS felt taxed — but my heart? Absolutely cruising.

### Why This Matters

This run didn’t happen in isolation:
- A strong **long base run** last week
- A solid **threshold workout** (2x19') with full control
- Followed by the **best tempo run of the year**
- And now this — a base effort that felt smooth and efficient

🧠 **Context**:  
Just one year ago, I was running this exact pace (~5:50/km) with an average heart rate of **166–167 bpm**.  
That’s a **23–24 bpm** difference — not from a single breakthrough, but from consistent training and recovery over time.

This wasn’t just a physical milestone. It was **visible proof of aerobic adaptation** in motion.

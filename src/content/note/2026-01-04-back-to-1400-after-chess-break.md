title: Back to 1400+ After a Chess Break

I barely played chess in 2025 — maybe three months total.  
But for pure brain hygiene, I jumped back in on **Dec 28**.

### Warm-up: Lichess alt, pure chaos (in a good way)
I created a fresh **alt account** on Lichess and played **8 games**.

- Result: **8/8 wins**
- Rating jumped to **1975** — obviously **provisional** with high **rating deviation**
- The “this might not be a fluke” moment: I beat a player rated **1848** with **4500+ games**

Yes, provisional spikes are noisy. But still: you don’t accidentally go 8–0 while playing like a tourist.

### Reality check: Chess.com and the “stop hiding” moment
Then I moved to Chess.com:

- On an alt, I hit **1434** with **provisional** volatility.
- On another account, I had **1426** — also likely a good streak + deviation doing its thing.

At that point I thought: fine. Enough ego games.  
Time to go to the **main account** and finally earn **1400** properly.

### Main account: no free lunch
Four–five months earlier I tried to push to 1400, failed, and even dropped below 1300.  
This time the story was different:

- Losses started showing up (good — it means I’m actually in my pool).
- **RD (rating deviation)** stabilized around **64**.
- After **19 games**, on **Jan 4**, I hit **1407** on the main account.

Three accounts at 1400+ is not “lucky variance” anymore.  
Call it **validated**.

### What actually changed
The progress didn’t come from nowhere — I could feel my game was simply stronger.

This time I played around **exchanges** and **restriction**: I traded only when it reduced my opponent’s piece activity and made their pieces less effective.  
I’d read Hellsten’s *Mastering Chess Strategy* before and couldn’t apply it — now the **Exchanges** ideas finally clicked.

### Next target
1400 is done. Next: **1500**.

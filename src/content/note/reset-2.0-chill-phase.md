## Frustrated Recovery (Jun 26 – Jul 10)

I’m entering a recovery phase, not because I want to, but because I have to.

After finishing a brutal 4-month training cycle on May 28, I tried to re-enter training with some structure — a couple of lighter weeks, some base runs, then moderate threshold work. But somewhere in the second week, things began to break down:

- Base pace collapsed from ~5:45/km to over 6:15/km at the same HR (or higher)
- HRV dropped during what was supposed to be recovery
- VO2max fell by 2.5 points despite consistent activity
- Garmin flagged “strained” on easy days
- I felt power only in the first kilometer of any workout, then the “engine overheated”

It’s frustrating. I always feel like everything comes to me the hard way. And even when I finally reach a new level, something finds a way to fall apart right after. That’s how it feels now.

But okay. I’ll try to be smart this time.

## Reset 2.0 – The Plan

For the next two weeks, I’m doing something I’d usually avoid: a **strictly controlled reset**.

- 3–4 base runs/week, 20–30 minutes each, no faster than 6:15/km
- HR cap at ~150, ideally 140–145
- 1–2 long walks/week (5–8 km)
- No threshold, no intervals, no trying to prove anything
- Watch HRV, RHR, and mood

The goal isn’t to progress. It’s to stabilize.

## Why?

Because I know myself. I could keep pushing — I’ve done it before. But I also know how that ends: worse burnout, longer fatigue, months wasted. So maybe this time I take the cue early. Maybe this becomes my version of a mid-season off-cycle, like I naturally have in winter (Nov–Feb), where I usually come back stronger.

At least I’m not injured. That’s something.

And maybe — just maybe — slowing down now buys me speed later.

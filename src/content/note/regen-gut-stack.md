title: Regen Gut Stack â€“ Post-Cycle Recovery Phase
publishDate: "2025-06-14T10:00:00Z"

After completing an intense two-month **NeuroForge protocol**, I decided it was time to step back and give my system a break â€” especially my **digestive tract**, which has long been my weakest link.

This new phase, starting **June 14th**, is focused on **gut regeneration**, **systemic downshifting**, and preparing for future neuro and performance phases with a stronger foundation.

### ðŸ§­ Phase Goals:
- Soothe and regenerate the gastrointestinal lining
- Rebalance gut microbiota after a heavy supplement load
- Support nutrient assimilation and long-term neuro + hormonal health
- Transition off most neuro-support supplements without withdrawal effects

### ðŸ§˜ Notes

This is a **deload phase**. Thereâ€™s no rush, no pushing for more performance.  
I want to **retrain my system to thrive on less**, consolidate the gains from previous months, and give space for **recovery and adaptation**.

Just like in strength training â€” **you donâ€™t grow during the lift, but in recovery.**

This is my recovery.

**Regen Gut Stack begins.**

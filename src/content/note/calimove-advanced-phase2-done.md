Completed Phase 2 (Macrocycle) of **Calimove Advanced Level 3**.

This was the real start of calisthenics:
- 1 test week, 4 grind weeks
- 4 workouts/week
- Each session started with a **handstand routine**
- Two sessions per week with a 5-set structure (3 main sets, 2 accessory, 1 finisher), others with 4 sets
- Long rest periods: 3 minutes for hard exercises, 2 minutes for easier ones

**Coming back rusty.**  
Test week was a clear reminder: my pulling strength dropped after a break.  
Pull-ups (overhand) went down from 17 to 13.  
Chin-ups? No test, but I could tell — no way I’d hit 21 again like I did a month earlier.

**Exercises introduced:**
- Handstand  
- Skin the Cat  
- L-Sit  
- Typewriter Pull-Up  
- Archer Push-Up (rings)  
- Pistol Squat  
- Hanging Side Lean  

**Progress notes:**
- **Handstand**: Week 1 I couldn’t even stay up on the wall. Week 2 — a few seconds. Week 3 — I could hold. Week 4 — started feeling strength and the fun of balancing.
- **Skin the Cat**: Felt easy, a bit of cheating at first, but clean by the end.
- **Typewriter Pull-Up**: Manageable — pull-ups have always been a strength.
- **Archer Push-Up**: Wobbly at first, but steady progress. Felt the control by the end.
- **Pistol Squat**: My weak point — can do partials, but full is far off (weak legs + poor mobility).
- **Hanging Side Lean**: Surprisingly easy, likely the first step toward a Human Flag.

In the final week, I finally felt **true strength across all exercises**.  
The body caught up. Calisthenics is officially on.

title: First Lactate Scout Measurements

Finally, I’ve got my **Lactate Scout Sport** — and, unlike most people, I actually started by reading the manual 😄  
(Good thing I did: the strip code had to be changed in the device first.)

As it turns out, measuring lactate isn’t that simple.  
My **first test** was a mess: the blood drop was too small, I pressed the strip too hard, and the result came back **4.0 mmol/L at rest**, which made no sense.  
A moment later, more blood started flowing (the 2.4 mm / 21G lancets are no joke).  

Then I went for a run:  
- **Easy run:** ~5:40 / km, upper Z2 → **3.8 mmol/L**.  
- **Tempo segment:** 3.2 km @ 4:42 / km, avg HR 171 → 177 bpm at the end → **4.3 mmol/L**.

Testing blood mid-run was a hassle:  
blood flowed much faster with high HR, I ended up with a hand literally covered in blood, strips kept throwing errors, and each test took over a minute.

Three hours after the session, lactate was **0.9 mmol/L** at rest,  
and the next morning (fasted) **1.2 mmol/L**.

### Takeaway
Garmin’s **LTHR estimate (177 bpm at ~4:42 / km)** seems reasonably accurate.  
But the key insight is that what my watch calls *“easy”* may not actually be easy for my body —  
my real **Z2 could be sitting in the gray zone**, with lactate already between **2–3 mmol/L**.

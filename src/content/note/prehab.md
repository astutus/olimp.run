### ðŸ§  Objective

Following a consultation with the Calimove team, Iâ€™m adding two weekly support sessions to improve progress in **L-sit** and **pistol squat** during Phase 3â€“4 of the Advanced program. These are not full workouts, but **technical activations** designed to improve control, mobility, and awareness without overloading the system.

### âœ… Tuesday â€“ L-Sit Activation (15 minutes)

- Sitting Leg Raise (1 leg) â€“ 2Ã—5â€“8 per side  
- Reverse Plank Hold â€“ 2Ã—30 sec  
- Tuck Compression Drill (floor sit, hands beside hips, lift knees) â€“ 2Ã—10 sec  
- Lying Leg Raise (legs straight) â€“ 2Ã—10  
- Dead Bug (with active core tension) â€“ 2Ã—10

### âœ… Thursday â€“ Pistol Prehab (20 minutes)

- Deep Lunge w/ ankle mobility â€“ 2Ã—30 sec per side  
- Bulgarian Split Squat (no weight) â€“ 2Ã—6 per leg  
- Wall Sit â€“ 2Ã—30â€“45 sec  
- Negative Pistol (using stick or doorway for balance) â€“ 2Ã—slow descents  
- Glute Bridge March â€“ 2Ã—10 (alternating legs)

---

### ðŸŒ™ Evening Stretching Sessions (Tuesday + Thursday)

Instead of doubling Mobility 2.0 volume, I include relaxing evening stretches to unwind and support recovery:

- Pigeon Stretch â€“ 2Ã—30 sec per side  
- Lunge with rotation â€“ 2Ã—30 sec per side  
- Seated Forward Fold â€“ 2Ã—30 sec  
- Seiza Sit + Ankle stretch â€“ 2Ã—20 sec  
- Diaphragmatic Breathing â€“ 3Ã—10 deep breaths

These sessions aim to build smarter control and joint preparation for better long-term gains in L-sit and pistol squatâ€”without risking overtraining.

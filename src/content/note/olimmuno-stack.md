-----------------------------------

On May 3rd, a fascinating and unexpected result came from my **Olimmuno Stack**â€”specifically from NAC, L-Citrulline, Resveratrol, and Thorne multivitamin.

Earlier this week, I was feeling significantly under the weather with a stubborn cold that typically would linger. In a moment of desperation, I doubled up the stack, and to my surprise, experienced an incredible turnaround within **a single day**. Usually, such colds take several days to subside, but this time it was almost instantaneous.

### ðŸš€ Immediate Effects Noticed:

* **Rapid decrease in inflammation and congestion**.
* **Significant improvement in energy levels**.
* **Overall sense of quick recovery and resilience**.

### ðŸ§ª Why Did This Work?

* **NAC**: Powerful immune modulator, antioxidant, and mucolytic.
* **Resveratrol**: Strong anti-inflammatory, immune-boosting antioxidant.
* **Multi (Thorne)**: Key micronutrients (Zinc, Vitamin C, Selenium) that strongly support immunity.
* **L-Citrulline**: Enhances blood flow, optimizing nutrient delivery and tissue oxygenation.

### ðŸ“Œ Insights and Next Steps:

* This rapid recovery is strong evidence of the potency and synergy within the stack.
* I now have a reliable and tested protocol for accelerating recovery from common colds or similar infections.

This experience reinforced my approach: **targeted supplementation can genuinely trigger accelerated healing**. No placebo here, just biochemistry working as intended.

I should also mention another supplement that has consistently shocked me with its effectiveness: **high-quality colostrum**. In the past, during a serious outbreak of stomach flu (with vomiting and diarrhea hitting everyone around us), only my daughter and Iâ€”who happened to be taking colostrum at the time as part of a planned immune-support cycle before travelâ€”remained completely unaffected. It felt like we were protected by an invisible biological shield. That memory still stands out as one of the most striking testaments to the power of immune-priming supplementation.

This protocol will now be known as the **Olimmuno Stack** â€” my go-to rapid resilience system for recovery, immune defense, and bounce-back readiness.

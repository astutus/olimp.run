## Summary of Strategic Build Phase (Jun 11 – Aug 6)

After completing 17 weeks of Garmin Coach Adaptive (100 runs, 700km), I'm implementing an 8-week progressive build focused on quality over quantity. This phase addresses the missing elements from the previous cycle while preserving the aerobic base.

### Key Objectives
- **Restore CNS balance:** 3x/week maximum to protect testosterone levels
- **Fill training gaps:** Structured sprints and hill work (completely absent in previous 17 weeks)
- **Progressive loading:** Start conservative, build to race-ready intensity
- **Smart recovery:** Walk breaks as a tool, not a weakness

### Training Zones (Based on LTHR 175, Max HR 190)
- **Z1:** 105-140 bpm (Recovery)
- **Z2:** 142-150 bpm (Base)
- **Z3:** 152-161 bpm (Tempo)
- **Z4:** 163-165 bpm (Threshold)
- **Z5:** 166-191 bpm (VO2max/Speed)

### Phase Structure

**Weeks 1-2: Restart**
- Tempo intervals with walk breaks
- Short hill introductions
- Base maintenance at true Z2

**Weeks 3-4: Power Development**
- Sprint work begins (6x100m)
- Threshold intervals introduced
- Progressive runs added

**Weeks 5-6: Full Intensity**
- VO2max sessions (5x800m @175-185 bpm)
- Sprint pyramids
- Tempo/threshold combinations

**Weeks 7-8: Peak & Test**
- Race-pace specificity
- 5K time trial target: sub-21:50

### Critical Warm-up Protocols

**Tempo/Threshold Sessions:**
- 10-15min @Z2 + 3-4x100m strides
- Total session: 40-50min

**VO2max/Sprint Work:**
- 15-20min progressive (Z1→Z2→Z3) + dynamic drills
- Total session: 50-60min

**Hill Sessions:**
- 10-15min to hill base + 3x30s practice runs
- Total session: 40-45min

### Recovery Indicators
- **Green light:** HRV >110, RHR <42, legs feel springy
- **Yellow light:** HRV 100-110, modify intensity
- **Red light:** HRV <100, recovery day only

### Expected Outcomes
- Restored speed/power (missing from high-volume phase)
- Maintained aerobic base (VO2max 51+)
- Improved hormone profile (testosterone recovery)
- Strategic readiness for next training cycle

### Lessons Applied
This phase represents training maturity — knowing when to push and when to preserve. After 3 years of Garmin Coach experiments, this custom approach balances what worked (consistency, structure) with what was missing (power, recovery, life balance).

The goal isn't just another PR — it's sustainable performance as a tool for life.

title: Signal Ratio – Why I Fucking Hate Meetings

Recently, I stumbled upon a brilliant metric that perfectly captures the **quality of communication** – in meetings, in leadership, in life.  
It's called **Signal Ratio**.

Originally from engineering (signal-to-noise ratio), it’s now showing up in productivity circles and leadership talks. The core idea is dead simple:

> **How much of what you're saying is actually *signal* – and how much is just noise?**

Kevin O’Leary, a former Apple vendor, once said:  
> “Jobs had maybe 80/20 – 80% signal, 20% noise.  
> But the only person he knew who was better was Elon Musk.  
> He’s basically at 100% signal.”  

That hit me hard.  
Suddenly I understood **why I fucking hate meetings**.

Not because they’re boring.  
Not because they’re long.  
Not even because people talk too much.

But because the **Signal Ratio is like 5/95**.  
5% signal.  
95% bullshit.

And since I lead with **Strategic Thinking** in my Gallup strengths — with themes like *Learner*, *Focus*, *Analytical* and *Intellection* — this shit hits me even harder than most. I don’t just want action. I want clarity, precision, and ideas that matter.

### 🚀 What’s next?

Now I’m wondering — if AI can summarize meetings, **why not measure Signal Ratio** too?

Like seriously:
- How many decisions were made?
- How many actionable insights?

And at the end, just give me a clean stat:

> **Signal Ratio: 14% — you could’ve emailed this.**

If that tool exists — I want it.  
If it doesn’t — maybe we should build it.

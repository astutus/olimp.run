### ðŸ§  Why

Recurring neck tightness and tension headaches often come from overloaded **postural chains**: handstand, pull work, desk time, even chess.  
Sometimes, even a single **painkiller (like ibuprofen)** seems to *"magically fix it the next day"*. But thatâ€™s not the point â€” the real goal is not to **mute the body's intelligent signals**, but to actually respond to them.  
This micro-routine is designed to **reset your traps, upper spine and cranial nerves** in under 5 minutes.

Can be done **2â€“4Ã— per week**, especially:
- after long work or chess sessions,  
- after upper body training (pulls, dips, handstand),  
- or **as a mid-day break** to restore posture and calm the nervous system.

title: Training Load vs. Cognitive Performance

From the beginning, I’ve treated running, calisthenics, and mobility as an **investment in health**.  
These are not just workouts, but part of my daily framework designed to **regenerate the brain and sustain intellectual performance**.  

### When balance breaks
I’ve noticed this three times already: when training intensity goes too high (as it is now in **week 12 of Amy’s plan**), things start to fall apart:  
- **brain fog** — harder to enter flow,  
- fewer **deep work sessions**, and the ones I do manage are shallower,  
- even **NeuroForge**, which normally gives me a huge cognitive boost, doesn’t help this time.  

It’s not just a subjective feeling. The body also signals overload:  
- **HRV fluctuations** — values lost their stability,  
- **heart rate drift** — less control at given paces,  
- **sleep not fully restorative** — hours in bed are there, but recovery is incomplete.  

### Takeaways
This confirms that **excessive physical load drains mental fuel**.  
The point is not to avoid intensity, but to seek **symbiosis**: physical activities should support intellectual ones, not exist at their expense.  

### What’s next?
I’ll finish Amy’s plan — three weeks left.  
After that, I’ll take **two weeks of deload** and move into a **very easy base and technique phase**.  
The goal for winter is to create a system where running, calisthenics, and mobility are a **natural support for mental work**, not a drain on the nervous system.

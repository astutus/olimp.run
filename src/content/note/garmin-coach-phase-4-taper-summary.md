The **TAPER** phase of the Garmin Coach 5K adaptive plan ran from **May 19 to May 27**, aiming to reduce volume while maintaining intensity to let the body supercompensate and arrive fresh for race day.

### Summary
Despite the taper framework, my **legs never fully regained freshness**. Each day included ~40 minutes of base running — low intensity but consistent. There was **no break long enough** to allow a true taper bounce.

- **Garmin showed PEAK readiness briefly**, about 5 days before race day.
- That peak vanished within two days, replaced by *productive*, then *maintenance*.
- After the final session — a 29-minute run with **5x 15s sprints** (~4:05/km pace) — the system unexpectedly **crashed me into RECOVERY** status.
- HRV and resting HR, which had been excellent throughout the taper (HRV: ~130+, HR: 40 bpm), also **dropped sharply** the day before the final race.

### Observations
- **Training load was never truly reduced enough** to allow full freshness, despite the "taper" label.
- The final workout may have been too taxing: while short, the sprint segment hit hard, possibly triggering excessive recovery demand.
- Body responded *well*, but signals were mixed — legs felt heavy, but **cardiovascular performance remained solid**.

### Metrics During Taper
- **HRV:** Peaked at 133, dropped before race
- **Resting HR:** 40 bpm, stable until drop
- **Daily base runs:** ~5:50–6:00/km @ HR ~145
- **Final workout:** 5x15s sprints on May 27 — possibly disrupted peaking curve

### What’s Next
Now that taper is complete, it’s time to race. Based on feel and metrics, I’m cautiously optimistic — the **engine is strong**, even if the **chassis feels a bit worn**. Let’s see what the final test shows.

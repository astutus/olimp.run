title: Amy Plan – The Most Brutal Start Yet

On June 15th, I officially began the **Amy Parkerson-Mitchell 5K Garmin Plan** — with a time goal of **22 minutes on 5K**.

Honestly? I **did not expect** this plan to be hard.  
I assumed the real difficulty in running plans comes from **volume**, not intensity.  
My intention for this year was to follow a similar structure to the 17-week adaptive plan I’d done before — lots of long runs, up to 17 km even in a 5K plan. And I was ready for that kind of grind.

But this? This started **brutally**:

- The **benchmark** had me flying at 95–100% HR for almost 4 minutes.  
- The very next day? **Speed repeats** — six sprints of 1.5 minutes at redline.  
- Then came the “tempo” workout, which I completely **gave up on pacing-wise**.  
  I was supposed to run at my final goal pace, but I was already crushed. I ran it **30 seconds slower**, keeping it in Zone 3 just to finish.

To make things worse, the benchmark revealed the truth:  
**3:44/km on 1K**, a full **10 seconds off my PR**.  
I secretly hoped I’d hit a new record there.  
I had **zero chance**.

This first week just **wrecked me**.

- **Sleep** dropped hard. From Garmin scores of 75–85 down to 65–74.  
- **HRV** dipped to 112 (my range is 118–132).  
- **Resting heart rate** climbed from 41 to 46.  

I honestly thought about quitting.  
But a few things held me back:  
1. It’s a new stimulus — I’ve never trained like this.  
2. Online reviews mention that **many people drop out**, but those who **survive break their PRs**. And looking at this brutality, I believe it.  
3. I know I can **grind through pain** — I’ve done it before.

But here’s the worry:  
Looking back at 2024, I wonder — will this just be **another Pyrrhic victory**? A new PR… but a broken body?

My strategy:  
Don’t be super strict.  
**Listen to my body**.  
And try to stay in this game — not just finish it, but **grow stronger** through it.

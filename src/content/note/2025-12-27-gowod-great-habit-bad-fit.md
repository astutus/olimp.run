title: "GoWOD: Two Months In, Then My Back Voted No"

For almost **two months** I went all-in on GoWOD.

At first it was **8 minutes a day**, then I got hooked and it became closer to **~16 minutes daily**.  
My mobility score climbed (about **+17%**), the streak was strong, and for once this felt like a clean, sustainable system.

And then — instead of a reward — I got a penalty.

On **18 Dec 2025** during **pancake** and some hip “push-out” style drills I felt a warning in my lower back.  
Later that same day I still went to the gym and trained lower body (**Bulgarian split squats** + **Romanian deadlifts**).  
That’s when I got a sharp “my back just went out” moment on the **right side** of my lower back.

The next day was brutal.  
Day two wasn’t better, so I took a tablet to help it release faster.  
It improved, I could move and train again — but the area stayed sensitive.

On **26 Dec 2025** I tried to “help” with passive long-sit stretching (legs straight forward) plus hip rotations… and it flared again.

This is uncomfortably similar to what happened **two years ago**: big flexibility gains, then a twist, then the worst back episode of my life.

So I’m done outsourcing this to an app.

## Plan

- quit GoWOD (the habit stays, the app doesn’t)
- build my own short mobility sessions as a **Garmin workout list**
- keep a strict “do-not-do” blacklist for movements that irritate my back  
  (especially deep end-range flexion + rotation)
- bias toward **active mobility** and stability over passive end-range stretching

Two months of work did build one valuable thing: consistency.  
Now I’ll keep the consistency — and remove the randomness.

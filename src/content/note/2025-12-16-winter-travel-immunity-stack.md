I’m running a simple supplement plan to stay resilient through a busy winter stretch:
family winter break (ski trip to **Białka Tatrzańska**) and a work trip to **Las Vegas**.

## Timeline

**From 1 Dec 2025 → mid-Jan 2026**
- **creatine**
- **ashwagandha**

**From 15 Dec 2025 → end of Jan 2026**
- **NAC**
- **resveratrol**

**Planned from 1 Jan 2026 → end of Jan 2026**
- **colostrum** (immune support “insurance” for travel)

## Goal

Not chasing “biohacking points” — just aiming for a strong baseline:
better recovery, less chance of getting sick, and fewer disruptions during trips.

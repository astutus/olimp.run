title: Returning the Lactate Scout Sport

Unfortunately, I have to **return the Lactate Scout Sport**, as the device turned out to be **too inconsistent and unreliable** for field use.

After consuming over **20 strips**, only about **five readings** seemed trustworthy â€” the rest were completely off.  
For example, during todayâ€™s *easy run* (cool weather, HR ~142 bpm, pace ~6:20/km), the device reported absurdly low values of **0.5â€“0.7 mmol/L**.  
Just two days earlier, after **7 Ã— 1.5-minute intervals at 3:57/km**, it showed **9.4 mmol/L**, which made sense.  
Similarly, on an earlier easy run (~6:20/km), I got **2.4 mmol/L**, again plausible.

So the pattern is clear:  
ðŸ‘‰ the meter performs fine **indoors**, but becomes unreliable **outdoors** â€” especially in **cold (6â€“10 Â°C)**, **humid**, or **rainy** conditions typical of autumn.  
The **strips are extremely sensitive** to temperature and moisture, which makes real-world measurements impractical.

For verification, I ran a **control test** using the manufacturerâ€™s calibration solution:  
at a reference of 10 mmol/L, the device displayed **10.3 mmol/L**, confirming that the **analyzer itself is accurate**.  
The issue clearly lies in **environmental sensitivity**, not the internal calibration.

### A word on Allmed
The distributor, **Allmed**, showed **remarkable professionalism and empathy** throughout the entire process.  
They advised me patiently, suggested potential troubleshooting steps, and supported my efforts to identify the root cause.  
Wanting to be fair, I even **asked them to reduce the refund** amount slightly and covered the cost of the test materials myself â€” it felt right to do so after such great customer service.

### Conclusion
While the Lactate Scout Sport works fine in lab-like conditions, itâ€™s **not a reliable tool for field testing** during typical outdoor training seasons.  
Consistency is everything when youâ€™re tracking physiological adaptation â€” and this device simply canâ€™t deliver that under variable weather.

Still, it was a **fun experiment â€” and I learned a lot about how sensitive lactate testing really is**.  
Alsoâ€¦ quite a painful one ðŸ˜… â€” I used the deepest **21G / 2.4 mm lancets**, which left real bruises. Now I know: **1.8 mm max next time!**

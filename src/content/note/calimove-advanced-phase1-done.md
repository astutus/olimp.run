Just finished Phase 1 (macrocycle) of the *Calimove Advanced* program â€” 3 sessions a week, 4 sets per exercise, short 1-minute breaks.

It felt like a much-needed reset: structured, low-friction reentry after months of high-intensity pull-up routines.

Surprising takeaways:
- **Planche Lean** â€” harder than expected, core and shoulder control put to the test.
- **Easy Bridge Lean** â€” surprisingly manageable.
- **Jumping Lunge** â€” absolutely destroyed my legs.
- **Sitting Leg Raise** â€” shocking lack of control over my own body ðŸ˜…

No pull-ups in this phase â€” a deliberate pause. Iâ€™ll reflect more on that in Phase 2.

A great opening. Simple, clear, humbling.

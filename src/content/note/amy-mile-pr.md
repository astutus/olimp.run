October 1st, and something finally clicked.  
The grind started paying off.

### Mile benchmarks
- **Week 11 (Sep 28)** – Benchmark mile in **6:18**. Stable pace ~**3:55/km**, with gas left in the tank.  
- **Week 12 (Oct 1)** – Benchmark again: **6:11**. Average **3:51/km**. This one hurt. I kept it stable, but the last stretch was no joke.

Two mile PRs in just four days.  

### The grind
I know where it comes from.  
The **7 × 3 minutes at ~4:00/km** (with 3-minute rests) are the hardest workouts I’ve ever done.  
They broke me mentally.  

When I saw them on the plan, I dreaded them days in advance. Like a dentist appointment — or worse.  
But those sessions built this result. No shortcuts.

### Metrics and adaptation
- **HR**: topping at 186–187 instead of 191–192 in repeats. Progress.  
- **VO₂max**: now **51** — back on the rise.  
- **HRV**: still high, often ~130.  
- **Sleep**: steady, 80+ Garmin scores, thanks to earlier bedtime.  

### Reflection
These mile benchmarks prove the suffering isn’t wasted.  
Amy’s plan is brutal, but it’s forging something new.  
I don’t know yet if I can carry 4:20/km for a full 5K — but mile by mile, rep by rep, I’m closer.

Grind. Adapt. Survive. Break PRs.  
That’s the cycle.

title: Genetic Reset – Eating Window and Food Triggers

-----------------------------------

A recent podcast reminded me how deeply individual our dietary needs can be.
So I decided to check my **genetic profile** — not just out of curiosity, but to see what my DNA actually says about what helps or hurts my performance.

Turns out? My body had been whispering the truth all along.

The analysis confirmed many of my long-held intuitions:

* I naturally **prefer carbs** and metabolize them well, but I gain fat easily if they come too late in the day.
* I don't crave fatty meats — and genetically, I'm better off **avoiding saturated fats and processed meats**.
* My body doesn't handle **overeating late at night**. This isn't just a lifestyle thing — it's in my genes.

That last point hit home the hardest. So I’ve returned to what older generations used to say:
**"Don’t eat late."**

Now I follow an **8-hour eating window**, starting in the morning and finishing no later than **16:00–17:00**. The goal isn’t restriction — it's alignment.

### What I’m avoiding:

* Evening meals
* Late-night snacking (especially sugars)
* Saturated animal fats (like pork or fatty beef)
* Overeating in general — my appetite control genes are strong, I just have to let them work

### Genetic markers that shaped this shift:

* `rs780094` – sensitivity to carb timing (early carbs = good, late carbs = fat gain)
* `rs9939609` (FTO) – hunger regulation, tendency to overeat
* `rs174537` – fat metabolism, increased inflammation with excess omega-6
* `rs4988235` – lactose tolerance (mine = tolerant, but not enthusiastic)
* `rs4994` (ADRB3) – impacts fat-burning capacity
* `rs1558902` – satiety signaling, impulsivity with food
* `rs1535` – low DHA levels, increased demand for omega-3 (now supplementing with Nordic Naturals DHA)

This isn’t about following a trend.
It’s about **syncing my behavior with my biology** — and respecting the subtle truths my body has been showing me all along.

title: Genetic Cognitive Blueprint – Ideal Daily Cycle
publishDate: "2025-08-28T10:00:00Z"

For a long time, I sensed that my brain had **two modes**: strong analytical bursts in the morning, and calm, structured reflections in the evening. I finally decided to put that intuition to the test by analyzing my genetics — and it turns out I was spot on. 🧬

Thanks to my SNP profile (especially **PER3**, **COMT**, **BDNF**, **ASB1**, **DRD2**, **ADRA2B**), I now understand not only *how* I learn best, but *when*, *how long*, and *in what mental state*. This post is my blueprint — a cognitive schedule based on **genetic traits**, **self-observation**, and **biochemical optimization**.

## 🧠 Cognitive Chronotype: My Genetic Style

| Trait      | Genotype | Insight                                                                                    |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PER3**   | CC       | Morning-focused brainpower, better analysis early in the day                               |
| **COMT**   | AA       | High dopamine = intense focus, but also easy overstimulation – I need structured intervals |
| **BDNF**   | CT       | Slower neuroplasticity – I learn deeply, but need repetition and rhythm                    |
| **ASB1**   | CC       | Strong response to daylight – morning routines are biologically optimal                    |
| **DRD2**   | GG       | Higher dopamine signaling, good reward-based learning, but prone to multitasking trap      |
| **ADRA2B** | Del/Del  | Strong emotional memory – reflection and meaning-making are key to encoding                |

## 🧬 Ideal Day – Based on Genetics & Real Life

Yes, I work 8–17, but I *embed learning into my job*, and I structure deep work blocks in sync with my biology.

### ⏰ 07:30 – Wake up, Morning Alpha

* Wake, hydrate, dog walk, daylight.
* **Anki review while walking** – perfect match with how my brain starts the day.
* Creative but lightweight activities welcome (music, languages, light journaling).

### ⏰ 08:00–12:00 – Deep Work Peak

* AI learning, math, architecture, systems – hardest tasks first.
* Pomodoro cycles (2× 50:10) with timer.
* I don’t multitask here. Dopamine is high, so I guard my attention carefully.

### ⏰ 12:00–13:00 – Recovery & Lunch

* Walk or powernap (10–15 min).
* If I do IF (Intermittent Fasting), this is my first big meal.

### ⏰ 13:00–16:00 – Productive Flow

* Writing, code practice, debugging.
* Second Anki/language session (15–20 min).
* **Piano practice** fits perfectly here (neuroplasticity window).

### ⏰ 16:00–17:00 – Transition Out

* Strength training or dog walk.
* Mental deload from productive mode.

### ⏰ 17:00–22:00 – Reflective Mode

* Philosophy, strategy, chess analysis.
* Reading, journaling.
* **Evening = my deep reflection zone**, but not for learning brand new technical stuff.
* **Chess works well here** — surprisingly, I play better in the evening than in the morning. Strategic thinking kicks in.
* **Puzzle tactics** (short bursts) fit better around 13–16.

### 🛌 23:00 – Sleep

* My body *requires* 8 hours.
* I used to experiment with 06:00 wakeups, but despite the amazing mental clarity early on, I’d burn out by 12:00.
* Best combo? Sleep at 22:30–23:00, wake at 06:30–07:30.

## 🎯 Summary: Optimal Rules

* ✅ Morning = load RAM (deep learning)
* ✅ Afternoon = productive execution + creativity
* ✅ Evening = strategic reflection + journaling + chess
* ❌ No multitasking, no overstimulation
* ❌ Don’t underestimate sleep – my **deep sleep (NREM)** is key for memory consolidation

## 🧠 Bonus: NeuroForge Stack (from September)

To support my profile (low BDNF activity, intense dopamine use, energy-demanding brain), I’m launching a smart neuroprotection + cognition protocol:

* **Uridine + DHA + Citicoline** – membrane & synapse support
* **PQQ + CoQ10 + ALCAR** – mitochondria & energy
* **Magnesium L-Threonate + Rhodiola** – stress buffering & plasticity

## 🔚 Final Thought

I push myself hard – like an athlete, but with my mind. This schedule doesn’t restrict me. It protects me — from burnout, distraction, and wasted energy.

This is what my **genetic architecture** taught me. Now I respect it.

And on Sundays?
I rest, reflect, and plan. As it was always meant to be. ☀️

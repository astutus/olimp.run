Finished the cycle. Subjectively the **weakest** so far — not because the stack “stopped working,” but because it overlapped with a **very heavy training block** (see: [fall after the peak](/posts/deja-vu-fall-after-the-peak/)) and the **UC Berkeley Exec program** (*Artificial Intelligence: Business Strategies and Applications*). The combo of VO₂ sessions + deep study simply masked day-to-day effects.

### What I’ll keep (and for how long)
- **DHA** — continue for **~1 month**, then stop.  
- **Uridine** — continue for **~1 month**, then stop.

After that: **full 2-month break** from the stack. Planned restart: **~Feb 10, 2026**.

### What I actually ran
Daily protocol as in the Cycle 3 start note; effects were more “structural base” than “wow” under high load. 

### Takeaways
- Under high physical + cognitive stress, **perceived gains flatten** even if long-term building (mitochondria, membranes) continues.  
- **Sleep** held up; **HRV** was volatile and tracked intensity spikes.  
- The right move now is **homeostasis**: let the system self-regulate, keep only DHA/uridine one more month, then full off-cycle.

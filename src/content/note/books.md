For the last months, I’ve been focused intensely on physical development (running, calisthenics, recovery, sleep), and it’s been great.  
But as I look at the full picture, I realize: **there’s a part of me that thrives on intellectual challenge**. Not passive learning — but deep reflection, mental sharpening, and expanding frameworks of thought.

So I decided to initiate an **intentional intellectual reset** — a structured approach to reconnecting with reading and reflection, not for relaxation, but for long-term growth.  
This isn’t just “reading more.” This is about **reclaiming the mental edge** through philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, habit-building, and personal mastery.

After a short research and reflection, here’s the essential list that stood out — all high-impact titles I either missed or never finished. Time to change that.

## 🔹 Core Books for this Cycle

### **1. *Meditations* – Marcus Aurelius**  
A collection of private notes by a Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher.  
A raw, honest insight into the mind of a man balancing duty, mortality, and virtue.  
A manual of mental clarity and resilience — as real today as it was 2,000 years ago.

### **2. *The Art of Learning* – Josh Waitzkin**  
Chess prodigy turned Tai Chi world champion.  
This book is about deep mastery: learning how to learn, developing intuition, and staying focused under pressure.  
Perfect for anyone pursuing performance at a high level — in any domain.

### **3. *Atomic Habits* – James Clear**  
A sharp, systematic take on habit formation.  
More practical and actionable than Duhigg’s *Power of Habit*.  
If you want habits that stick and systems that scale — this is it.

### **4. *The Presence Process* – Michael Brown**  
A 10-week guided process to reconnect with your emotions through breathwork and awareness.  
More intense than mindfulness — this is inner work with direction and structure.  
Perfect for rebalancing energy and cultivating real inner stillness.

### **5. *Mastery* – Robert Greene**  
Not a motivational book — a strategic manual.  
Breaks down the path from apprenticeship to genius through the lens of history’s greatest minds.  
Essential if you value long-term development over shortcuts.

### **6. *The Black Swan* – Nassim Nicholas Taleb**  
A brutal takedown of our obsession with prediction and control.  
Finishing this book is long overdue — and the timing feels perfect.  
It’s less about statistics and more about preparing your mind for uncertainty.

## Summary of BASE Phase (Feb 5 – Mar 16)

The BASE phase of my adaptive Garmin Coach 5K training plan is now complete. Over these six weeks, the focus was on rebuilding aerobic fitness, dialing in recovery, and getting back into consistent mileage.

### Key Learnings

- **Started strong:** My first base run was at 6:02/km with an average HR of 152 — a solid reference point.
- **Garmin showed promise:** It intelligently adapted to poor sleep and fatigue, skipping sessions when needed, especially during my US trip.

### Unexpected Intensity
Despite being the “base” phase, several intensity sessions showed up:
- **Feb 18:** First threshold run — aimed for PB pace, ended up maxing HR at ~180.
- **Feb 20:** First VO2max session — 8x2:00 fast. Brutal. HR hit 185. Recovery took days.
- **Mar 5:** Planned tempo run became a threshold effort due to wind + misjudged pacing.

### Positive Adaptations
- **Improved endurance:** 10–15 km runs became manageable without high HR spikes.
- **Resting HR dropped** from ~44–45 bpm to 42 bpm.
- **HRV improved** from ~100–110 to 115–120.
- **Better awareness:** I learned to listen to my body more — not chase times blindly.

### Takeaway
This phase laid a strong foundation. Even though intensity crept in, the consistent base mileage and growing HRV trends suggest good aerobic progress.

I'm now ready to step into the **BUILD** phase with more structure and smarter pacing.

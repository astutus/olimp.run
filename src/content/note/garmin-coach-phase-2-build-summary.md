The BUILD phase of the adaptive Garmin Coach 5K plan wrapped up on **April 23**, and it’s been a transformative stretch.

### Summary
After a rocky BASE phase, I started BUILD with a mindset shift: **train by effort, not pace**. I stopped chasing numbers and focused on staying within proper heart rate zones — especially avoiding overcooking threshold workouts.

- **Threshold HR cap:** 174–175 bpm, avoiding anything above 177.
- March 20 marked the turning point — from then on, every tempo or threshold run was based on **heart rate control**.

### Highlights
- **April 22 – Best threshold workout yet:** 2x 19 min @ ~4:50/km, fully under control. Despite fatigue, I didn’t crack.
- **Base pace runs** dropped into the high 5:40s/km with HR well below 150 — previously unthinkable.
- **VO2Max graph started to rise** again after a long plateau.
- **HRV reached 130+ for the first time this year** (peak: 134), and **resting HR dropped to 40 bpm**.

### Physical Costs
- Right-side **groin tension** reappeared, especially post-intense sessions (VO2max, threshold).
- Ongoing **core fatigue** and **hip flexor soreness** — likely from calisthenics and hill segments.

Despite the high volume, I’m not burnt out — just aware. I’ve learned to listen to early signals (twinges, sleep quality, HR trends), and I adapted accordingly.

### What’s Next
**PEAK phase begins now.** It’s time to sharpen, taper smart, and see if the old PB (5K in 21:57) can finally fall. The plan continues through **May 28**, with a mix of threshold, VO2max and base runs.

Let’s see what four weeks of peaking can do.

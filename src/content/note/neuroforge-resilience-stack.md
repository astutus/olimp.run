title: NeuroForge – Cognitive + Athletic Resilience Stack

On April 15th, I officially launched my **NeuroForge protocol** — a long-term supplement plan aimed at building a stronger, more adaptable brain and nervous system. No stimulants. No nootropic shortcuts. Just real, evidence-based support for cognitive plasticity, performance, and structural integrity.

This isn’t about feeling better.
This is about **becoming better**.

I treat brain development the same way I treat athletic development:
With structure, discipline, and a clear intention to build and protect.

### 🎯 Purpose
To systematically strengthen my cognitive performance and neural resilience for:

- Deep work in chess and piano
- Technical and strategic problem solving
- Advanced calisthenics (e.g. handstands, L-sits, archer pushups)
- High-intensity running
- Complex book analysis ([reading list](https://olimp.run/notes/books/))

### 💊 Supplement Stack (April 15th launch)

| Supplement              | Purpose                                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Alpha-GPC (300 mg)** | Acetylcholine precursor — memory, focus, coordination           |
| **Phosphatidylserine** | Neuronal membrane building, cortisol modulation, sleep support |
| **Magnesium L-Threonate** | Synaptic density, working memory, neuroplasticity          |
| **DHA (Nordic Naturals)** | Neuron structure, brain development, long-term memory       |
| **Uridine**            | Synapse formation, membrane phospholipids                      |
| **PQQ**                | Mitochondrial biogenesis, energy metabolism, antioxidant        |
| **CoQ10 (Ubiquinol)**  | Mitochondrial support, ATP production, cardiovascular health    |
| **Resveratrol Elite**  | Hormonal modulation, sirtuin activation, anti-inflammatory      |
| **NAC**                | Glutathione precursor, detoxification, anti-oxidative protection|
| **Acetyl L-Carnitine** | Mitochondrial energy, cognitive stamina, neuroprotection        |
| **Thorne 2/Day**       | High-quality multivitamin to cover all micronutrient bases      |

## 🤝 Philosophy

**This is not a shortcut.**
It's a long-term architecture project.

Just like bones require calcium and weight-bearing stimulus to strengthen,
and muscles grow from progressive resistance + amino acids,
the nervous system needs nutrients, rest, challenge, and consistency to thrive.

There is no hype here. I don’t take stimulants. I avoid dependency.
Every compound above has been chosen for its structural, mitochondrial,
and neurorestorative value — not for a quick mental "high."

This protocol will run for at least 8 weeks.
After that, I’ll reassess based on how I perform — mentally, physically, emotionally.

Let’s see what can truly be rebuilt.
Let’s forge something strong.

**NeuroForge begins.**

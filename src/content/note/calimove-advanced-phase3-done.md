title: Finished Phase 3 of Calimove Advanced (Level 3/5)

Completed Phase 3 (Microcycle 3) of **Calimove Advanced Level 3** — but decided to **stop before entering Phase 4**.

Reason: I was deep in a very demanding phase of the **Garmin Coach Adaptive 5K** program, and had to run Calimove on a **10-day cycle instead of 7-day** to survive the combined load.

Despite that, I finished Phase 3 successfully and felt good about the progress. However, going into Phase 4 started to feel dangerous. Main issues:

- **Both elbows**: strong pain in insertions during typewriter rows on rings — classic symptoms of **bilateral golfer’s elbow (medial epicondylitis)**.
- **Groin strain**: persistent sharp pain during any **core work involving leg lowering** (e.g. skin the cat, L-sit).

Progress was real, but the cost was too high. My body isn’t ready for that volume yet.

**Strategic stop.** Health first. Plan now is to do **8-week lower-volume cycles**, maybe add some weights. When the body’s ready, I might return and go for Calimove Level 4 someday.

title: Caffeine Reset – 8-Week Exit Strategy

On July 13th, I started a deliberate 8-week reset from the most culturally normalized psychoactive substance: **caffeine**.

For years, I’ve had two rounds of double espresso daily — six shots total — not because I liked the taste, but because it worked.  
It got me into flow. It helped me stay focused.  
But eventually, I asked myself:

> “I cycle everything else — supplements, training, recovery…  
> Why not caffeine?”

### 🧠 Why I'm Doing This

Caffeine works by **blocking adenosine receptors**, and while it improves alertness in the short term, it's still a **stimulant**.  
Over time, it subtly rewires brain chemistry. Nothing in biology is free — everything has a cost.

Even though coffee helps me sit down and grind, I’ve noticed something strange:

> My **best insights**, creative bursts, and flashes of genius don’t happen *because* of caffeine —  
> They happen when I’m **off** it.

This reset is not about punishment or discipline theater.  
It’s simply part of my **long-term strategy for sustainable mental performance**.

### ⚙️ My 8-Week Off-Ramp Plan

**Week 1:** 2x single espressos (down from 2x doubles)  
**Week 2:** One double + one single  
**Week 3:** One double (10:00 only)  
**Week 4:** One single (10:00 only)  
**Week 5–6:** One espresso every other day  
**Week 7:** One espresso every third day  
**Week 8:** None

No tea, no yerba, no synthetic replacements.  
Just hot water with ginger, lemon, and chili — enough to wake the system up, not hijack it.

### 🛠️ Additional Stack Note

**Also started creatine monohydrate (5 g daily)** on this day —  
for the next 2 months, as my training volume ramps up after a 2.5-month deload phase.

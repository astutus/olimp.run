On **May 28**, I completed the **final 5K race** of my **17-week Garmin Coach adaptive training plan**.

### Final Result
- **Time:** 21:50  
- **Pace:** 4:21 / km  
- **Effort Rating:** 9/10 (very rare – only 2–3 runs in hundreds earned this)

### Reflections
Honestly, it was a **mixed feeling** — not bad, but **not the breakthrough** I had hoped for. I **beat my previous 5K record by 8 seconds**, which is still a win, but I expected more spark at the finish line.

That said, the race was **even and steady**, with a **visible improvement in heart rate control**:

- **1 km:** 4:21 / HR avg 173  
- **2 km:** 4:22 / HR avg 182  
- **3 km:** 4:22 / HR avg 184  
- **4 km:** 4:23 / HR avg 185 (**mini-crisis hit here**)  
- **5 km:** 4:18 / HR avg 185 — last 150m with a sprint finish

### Key Improvement
- **Average HR** dropped from **187 bpm** (previous cycle) to **181 bpm**.
- I **handled the critical phase better** — crisis came at 4 km this time, not 3 km like before.
- No collapse, **no giving up** — just consistent effort to the end.

### Conclusion
This wasn’t my most **inspired performance**, but it was one of the most **resilient**. I’ve come a long way in pacing, endurance, and mental fortitude. Next cycle will be stronger.

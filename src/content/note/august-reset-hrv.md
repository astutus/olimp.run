Between August 16th and 22nd, I spent a week in the mountains.  
Every day: **30–40k steps** and ~**800 meters up**, but all in **Zone 1** because I was with my daughter.  
It turned into the perfect form of recovery — movement without pressure, nature, and no training stress.

I also completed [my caffeine reset](/notes/caffeine-reset/).  
I’m proud: **no coffee**. First time in years, and I feel the difference.

And then, the peak metrics arrived:

- **Aug 21st:**  
  - Best HRV of the year: **139**  
  - Best resting HR of the year: **39**  
  - Best sleep score of the year: **96/100** (Garmin)  
  - Lowest stress of the year: **16** (Garmin)

Finally, I managed to flip my evening schedule.  
I’ve been consistently going to bed **before 23:00**.  
For me, as an *Achiever*, this has always been the hardest — I would stretch the day endlessly to “do one more useful thing.”  
But the best investment in tomorrow is to **go to sleep earlier today**.  

Let’s see how long I can hold it — I’ve never managed to keep this habit stable for long. 😅

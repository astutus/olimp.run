I’ve re-read *The Manipulation Game* (*Gra w manipulacje*) by Robert-Vincent Joule and Jean-Léon Beauvois multiple times. Each pass hits harder — not because the authors “teach tricks”, but because they explain the machinery that makes people *stick* to choices that were never worth sticking to.

This post is not a moral sermon. It’s a mechanics note: how **commitment**, **decision perseveration**, and a few deceptively simple techniques reshape what we do next — often without us noticing.

## The freeze effect: when a decision collapses the option space

The authors start with what they call the **freeze effect**: once people make a decision, they tend to behave consistently with it when the opportunity appears — as if the decision “freezes” the set of alternatives.

This is close to Cialdini’s *commitment & consistency*, but Joule & Beauvois go further:
- they unpack *why* lock-in happens,
- they show how it intensifies in social settings,
- and they connect it to escalation, sunk costs, and self-justification.

A decision isn’t just a point in time. It becomes a **constraint** on future behavior — especially when the person has a story like “this was my choice”.

### Public commitment is fuel — but not the engine

Cialdini’s classic conditions (active, public, voluntary) matter. Publicness raises the reputational cost of reversing course. But the deeper engine is internal: a decision becomes part of one’s self-image, and consistency becomes a way to protect that image.

### Outcome orientation amplifies freezing

One detail I found particularly practical: **being strongly outcome-oriented (achievement-driven) can amplify the freeze effect**. When the goal becomes “get the result”, it becomes easier to interpret persistence as virtue — and harder to interpret stopping as skill.

## Escalation, sunk costs, and traps: same spine, different levels

Joule & Beauvois connect three patterns that most people treat separately:

- **Escalation of commitment**: continuing a failing course of action because stopping would mean admitting error.
- **Sunk cost effect**: overweighting non-recoverable investments (money, time, energy, “face”) when deciding whether to continue.
- **Traps** (*sidła*): situations where each additional step increases the cost of exit and makes “just one more push” feel inevitable.

Psychologically, the spine is the same: **decision perseveration** powered by **self-justification**.

But the distinction between sunk costs and traps is worth stating explicitly:

> **Sunk cost is a bias in evaluation. Traps are situations structured to exploit that bias — incremental steps, no stop rules, and rising exit costs.**

### The practical antidote: stop rules, not willpower

“Be rational” is not an antidote. A better antidote is structural:
- define a **stop-loss** / investment limit *in advance*,
- and force periodic **zero-based decisions**: “If I were starting today, would I enter this again?”

## The key lever: free choice changes what happens later

Here’s one of the most important claims in the book (and it’s backed by classic social psychology work):

Two people can perform the same behavior — yet think differently afterward — depending on whether they experienced **free choice**.

The immediate behavior often isn’t the point. The point is what follows:
- With **free choice**, people are more likely to internalize (“I did it because I chose to”).
- With **constraint** (pressure, obligation, big reward, threat), people can externalize (“I did it because I had to”).

This is why small rewards can sometimes create stronger commitment than large ones: a large reward functions like an obligation and provides an external explanation. A small reward doesn’t — so people manufacture an internal one.

### Zimbardo (1969): free choice can match coercion on compliance — but not on internalization

The authors reference Zimbardo’s 1969 work: roughly **15 experiments** where “normal” participants (including children) were asked to perform actions they would not choose spontaneously, either under **free choice** or under **constraint**.

The striking result is that **compliance rates can be similar**. The divergence shows up later:
- under free choice: more internalization, more rationalization, more perseveration,
- under constraint: easier external attribution (“I had to”), weaker downstream effects.

### A concrete image: the father, the jump, and the ridiculous ice cream

A simple illustration captures the logic better than any abstract paragraph: a father wants his son to jump into water from a bridge. A threat or a big reward works as pressure — but it gives the child an external justification.

A “your choice” framing, or even a laughably small reward (“I’ll buy you an ice cream”), can create a stronger downstream effect. If the child does it, the external reason is too weak — so internal reasons step in:
“I chose it. I’m brave. I can do hard things.”

## Commitment is a bond between a person and their acts

The authors define *commitment* (zaangażowanie) as the bond between a person and their actions.

A small observation nails it: a neighbor who borrows something once can be refused the second time without much drama. But after the seventh time, refusing is no longer “just refusing” — it changes the *relationship norm*. History turns behavior into identity and expectation.

That’s commitment in the wild: not logic, not persuasion — **path dependence** in social form.

## Two kinds of acts: consistent vs inconsistent

Commitment can follow:
1) acts consistent with one’s beliefs/motivations, and  
2) acts inconsistent with them.

Consistent acts harden the underlying attitude — they increase resistance to later “attacks”.
Inconsistent acts are more interesting (and darker): they trigger **active rationalization**. If I freely do something that doesn’t fit my self-image, I’ll often change the image or the beliefs to restore coherence.

## Technique 1: Foot-in-the-door (FITD)

**Foot-in-the-door** works by getting a person to freely perform a small, low-cost act — which prepares acceptance of a later, costlier request.

Core structure:
1) a preparatory act that feels voluntary,
2) later: a direct request for a larger act,
3) higher compliance compared to people with no preparatory act.

Key details the book emphasizes:
- the first act can be *too small* to generate commitment,
- the two acts should be linkable (same project / same identity frame),
- time gaps in experiments tend to be short (often within ~7–10 days),
- the first act doesn’t always need full execution — sometimes a declaration is enough.

### A variant: FITD with a hidden request

The authors also point to a useful variant: the second request does not always need to be stated explicitly. Sometimes the **situation** elicits the “real” behavior after the preparatory act. When the “hidden” request is not too costly, the same logic can still operate.

### Labeling: push the act to a higher identity level

A powerful booster is **labeling**: honor the preparatory act with an abstract identity (“you’re the kind of person who…”) and the second request rides that identity.

At that point it’s less “do X” and more “be consistent with who you are”.

## Technique 2: Door-in-the-face (DITF)

**Door-in-the-face** is the opposite sequencing:
1) ask for something very large (likely refusal),
2) immediately follow with a smaller request (the real target).

The refusal is not a failure — it’s the setup. The second request looks like a **concession**, and social norms push people to reciprocate with a concession of their own.

Cialdini explains it via **reciprocity of concessions**: “I moved, so you move.”
The cost gap makes the second request feel like a real concession, which invites a counter-concession.

### The “charity frame” matters

One practical detail worth keeping: DITF is often strengthened when **both requests are justified by a “noble cause”**. That framing makes refusal feel psychologically costly (“I refused a good thing”), and the smaller request becomes an easy exit: “OK, at least I can do *this*.”

This is one reason why charitable campaigns frequently lean on DITF-like structures.

### Timing and channel: short gap, preferably face-to-face

DITF is fragile with time. It works best when the second request follows quickly — the “concession” must remain vivid.

The authors also stress the channel: **face-to-face** amplifies the effect, while phone contact is weaker because it lowers social pressure and makes disengagement easy.

## FITD vs DITF: similar effects, different time constants

Empirically, DITF often yields slightly higher immediate compliance (single-digit to ~10% improvements appear in some comparisons), but it decays fast with delay. If you separate the requests by days, the effect can collapse.

FITD is often “gentler” and more durable because it builds internal commitment, not just reciprocal concessions.

## Groups and extreme decisions: diffusion of responsibility

A side note the book mentions is still worth remembering: groups tend to drift toward **more extreme decisions**. One contributor is **diffusion of responsibility** — the felt cost of being wrong is distributed, so risk appetite rises.

This matters because commitment and escalation don’t happen only inside individuals; they also get amplified by group dynamics.

## Low-ball and bait-and-switch: when commitment is the real product

Once the groundwork is set, the authors move to techniques that exploit perseveration more explicitly.

**Low-ball**:
- get a “yes” under incomplete information about costs (or by inflating benefits),
- then reveal the real cost,
- and watch people defend their initial decision.

A closely related variant is **bait-and-switch** (przynęta):
- commit the person to a decision based on an attractive option,
- then remove that option (“not available anymore”),
- and offer a substitute that lacks the original benefit.

It works not because people are stupid — but because reversing the decision forces them to admit (to themselves) they were played. Many will pay to avoid that psychological hit.

## Reactance: the immune system of influence (and why good manipulators avoid it)

Direct persuasion often triggers **reactance**: “Don’t tell me what to do.”
That’s why effective techniques avoid overt pressure. They engineer situations where the person experiences:
- autonomy,
- coherence,
- and a self-authored narrative.

Manipulation works best when the target can sincerely say: “I decided.”

## What I’m taking from this (so far)

1) The behavior itself is often less important than whether it was experienced as **free choice**.  
2) Commitment is not “motivation”; it’s a **bond** that creates path dependence.  
3) **Outcome orientation** can amplify freezing: persistence becomes identity, stopping becomes failure.  
4) Many influence techniques are just different ways to manufacture the first step — and then let perseveration do the rest.  
5) The best personal defense is structural: **stop rules**, **zero-based reviews**, and awareness of identity-level framing.  
6) Traps are not just biases — they are **architectures** designed (sometimes accidentally) to exploit biases.

This is only the first half of the book, but it already explains an uncomfortable amount of real life: sales tactics, institutional inertia, sunk-cost projects, and the “why didn’t I stop earlier?” moments.

More notes will follow as I complete the second half.

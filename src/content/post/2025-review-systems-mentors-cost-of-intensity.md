# 2025 Review: Systems, Mentors, and the Cost of Intensity

2025 was the fullest year I’ve ever lived.

Not “busy” in the chaotic sense — *full* in the structured sense: training cycles, deep learning, books that rewired my thinking, real-world battles that forced applied skill, and a few moments so beautiful they recalibrated my internal scale.

This year had two dominant mentors:

1) **Jim Rohn** — discipline, responsibility, building your life deliberately.  
2) **LLMs** — a cognitive exoskeleton I integrated into daily life (ChatGPT first, then Claude/Gemini/Grok as comparisons and tools).

The outcome: massive progress.  
The cost: a pattern I can no longer ignore.

This post is both the story and the diagnosis.

## By the numbers (telemetry, not vibes)

These numbers are approximate — but the shape is undeniable:

- **New people (1:1) initiated by me:** **0**
- **Weeks with >2 hard sessions:** ~**47/52** (≈ **90%**)
- **Weeks with spiritual practice outside April:** ~**44/52**

Hard, concrete outputs:

- **Pulling strength PRs:** **22 chin-ups**, **17 pull-ups**
- **Skill milestone:** **L-sit** on bars
- **Running:** **5K PR ~21:48**; **mile ~6:12** (milestones and repeated “pyrrhic” pushes)
- **Chess:** broke **1400+** on two accounts; beat a **2400** bot (engine-rated)
- **Blog:** consistent publishing and note-taking (posts + notes) all year
- **Battles:** one major win; two high-stakes fights still ongoing (legal/administrative)

If you read nothing else, read this:
> This wasn’t “a bit imbalanced.”  
> This was systematic optimization for what gives immediate, measurable feedback.

## Books that shaped 2025 (reference list)

This is not a “reading list.” These were inputs that actively shaped decisions, systems, and identity:

### Philosophy / Spiritual
- **Marcus Aurelius — *Meditations***
- **The New Testament** (reflections, especially around Holy Week)
- **Michael Brown — *The Presence Process***

### Learning / Cognition / Mental models
- **Josh Waitzkin — *The Art of Learning***
- **Shane Parrish — *The Great Mental Models*** (series)
- **Mortimer J. Adler & Charles Van Doren — *How to Read a Book***
- **Kevin Horsley — *Unlimited Memory***

### Habits / Behavior / Personal development
- **James Clear — *Atomic Habits***
- **Robert Greene — *Mastery***
- **Dale Carnegie — *How to Win Friends and Influence People***
- **Jim Rohn** (lectures/audio as daily mentor content)

### Negotiation / Influence / Persuasion psychology
- **Robert Cialdini — *Influence***
- **Roger Fisher & William Ury — *Getting to Yes***
- **Jean-Léon Beauvois & Robert-Vincent Joule — *Petit traité de manipulation à l’usage des honnêtes gens***
  (commitment and persuasion dynamics)

### Finance / Wealth-building thinking
- **George S. Clason — *The Richest Man in Babylon***
- **Morgan Housel — *The Psychology of Money***
- **Anthony Pompliano — *How to Live an Incredible Life*** (a father-to-children transmission of wisdom)

### AI / Strategy
- **Kai-Fu Lee — *AI Superpowers***
- **Melanie Mitchell** (AI reflections and conceptual grounding)

> Note: I’m listing these because readers often ask for references — and because this year was built on inputs as much as outputs.

## The intellectual trigger: the “reset” that set the year in motion

Early in the year I created an **intellectual reset**: a structured reading plan through November.
That mattered because it wasn’t “I want to read more.”
It was: **here is the sequence**.

Once a sequence exists, the system runs.

That reading trajectory became the backbone for everything else:
- reflection,
- mental models,
- strategic thinking,
- negotiation skill,
- financial awareness,
- and the AI path.

## The year, as it actually happened (month-by-month)

### January–February: Physical-first + travel contrasts
Early 2025 was heavily **PHYSICAL-first**. I trained hard, often without much restraint, because that’s what I know how to do: push.

There were also bright family moments:

- A ski trip with my daughter to **Białka Tatrzańska**, staying at **Hotel Bania** — one of those memories that stays warm even when everything else is “optimization.”
- Later: **Las Vegas** (a very different kind of environment). Coming back from that trip, I ramped training even harder.

In hindsight: the year started with a strong engine and a strong accelerator. Not enough brakes.

### March: Mobility enters the system (and my body said “finally”)
March was a real inflection point: I introduced **mobility** as a serious element, not a nice-to-have.

The effect was immediate and obvious: my body *thanked me*.  
Not in a motivational way. In a mechanical way.

This month also reinforced a rule I kept relearning all year:
> If something is not a **system**, it disappears.  
> If it becomes a **system**, it changes everything.

### April: The breakthrough month (Stoicism + spiritual intensity + origin story)
April was the “holy shift.”

- I started reading **Marcus Aurelius (Meditations)** and it hit hard. Reflection, discipline, perspective — not abstract philosophy, but practical mental posture.
- During **Holy Week**, I went deep into the **spiritual** dimension: Scripture, prayer, and intense reflection.
- There was also an origin story: being around colleagues who took faith seriously — including Muslim friends whose discipline and daily practice made me realize how shallow my own consistency was. That contrast mattered.

This month proved something important:
> I can go deep spiritually and mentally — when the environment and the structure support it.

I also launched **NeuroForge** — my own carefully designed nootropics stack aimed at *building*, not “boosting dopamine for vibes.”

And I spent a lot of time with my daughter — school life, routines, shared time. That mattered more than any metric.

### May: Final race + “Soldier → Commander”
May was performance and transition:

- I ran the final race and hit a concrete result: **5K ~21:48**.  
  I also logged a **mile ~6:12** later in the season.  
  I noticed something important: performance can improve while resilience quietly degrades if governance is missing.
- I kept reading (Waitzkin, Atomic Habits, Scripture).
- I had a critical identity insight:

> I can’t just “push like a soldier.”  
> I need to **lead** myself like a commander.

That’s not motivational fluff. It’s operational:
- Soldiers execute intensity.
- Commanders govern intensity.

I also ended the Calimove cycle because I could feel the system starting to extract a tax.

### June: AI becomes trajectory + gut recovery support
June is where **AI** became more than curiosity — it became trajectory.

I went deep: long study days, structured learning, and a serious commitment to building competence rather than consuming content.

I also supported recovery (gut-focused supplementation and general resilience), because performance is always physical in the end.

### July: Caffeine reset + brutal running block
July: I did a **caffeine reset** for the first time in ~15 years. It worked.

Then I started a brutal running block (Amy plan). The body adapts, but it doesn’t negotiate: you either manage load, or you pay.

### August: Jim Rohn + LLMs become daily operating system
August is when I discovered **Jim Rohn** and something clicked.

I started listening daily — often during morning movement.  
It wasn’t entertainment. It was installation of a worldview.

At the same time, my use of **LLMs** exploded. This wasn’t “asking questions.”  
This was building a daily feedback loop:
- thinking,
- writing,
- planning,
- learning,
- compressing experience into usable models.

At some point it felt like I had been running a multi-volume intellectual apprenticeship in real time.

### September: AI deepening + broad reading (including AI Superpowers)
September continued the AI path and the reading arc, including books like **AI Superpowers** and deeper reflections on what “AI transformation” really means (beyond hype).

A theme began to emerge:
- input is easy when you love it,
- governance is hard when you’re addicted to momentum.

### October: PRs, lactate experiments, and the “Fall after the peak”
October was a paradox month:

- I broke performance barriers again, but it often felt like a **pyrrhic victory**.
- I experimented with lactate measurement, trying to be more scientific about intensity management.
- I observed the trade-off clearly:

> Increased training load can reduce **cognitive performance**.  
> Brain fog is not a personality flaw. It’s a bill.

I also went deep into **Dale Carnegie** and human psychology — which, ironically, I mostly studied alone.

### November: Return to the gym + formal validation in AI
November was a structural reset:

- I returned to the gym after ~17 years (strategically, not randomly).
- I wrapped major cycles (including NeuroForge iterations).
- And I completed UC Berkeley Executive Education in AI **with distinction**, including an official recommendation letter.

I also kept developing cognitive performance indicators outside AI:
- **Chess** improvements (1400+ on two accounts, 2400 bot win) were not “about chess.”  
  They were about focus, pattern recognition, and sustained thinking under constraints.

### December: Negotiations, persuasion, and real-world tests
December was intense in a different way.

I studied and applied:
- **Cialdini** (*Influence*),
- **Fisher & Ury** (*Getting to Yes*),
- **Joule & Beauvois** (commitment and persuasion dynamics),

…because life presented real challenges where skills matter. Not theory. Real constraints, real stakes, real outcomes.

A quote that fits this month perfectly (and the entire year, honestly):
> **“Don’t wish you had less problems. Wish you had more skills.”**  
> — Jim Rohn

This year included major legal/administrative battles:
- one significant **win**,
- and **two ongoing fights** still in motion.

I also pushed mobility hard using GoWOD — results were great until they weren’t:
- improvement was real,
- then a back spasm reminded me that *apps don’t own your spine*.

And then: the most cinematic closing scene of the year.

On **December 30**, snow fell so heavily (Mazury) that it was the most intense winter landscape I’ve ever seen in my life.  
The kind of snow that makes the world look like it rebooted.

## What didn’t survive (and why it matters): the piano example

I also tried **piano**. I liked it. I had momentum — and then I didn’t.

Not because it was useless, but because it never became a **system**.

That matters because it’s a small, honest example of the core principle:
> What doesn’t get a slot in the system doesn’t survive — even if you genuinely want it.

---

## The finance thread: “money should work”
A major personal insight this year was financial — not about “getting rich quick,” but about **cash flow discipline**.

Books like *The Richest Man in Babylon* reinforced a simple rule I want to live by:
> Pay yourself first.  
> Money should **work**, not just sit.

That thread expanded into broader financial thinking (behavior, psychology, systems) — an area I want to treat as a real skill, not a background topic.

---

## Family: the mission behind everything
A lot of what I do, I do with one thought in the background:

> I want to pass this on.

Some books landed differently because they were explicitly written by fathers for their children — and that resonated deeply.  
Anthony Pompliano and Shane Parrish didn’t write those books as “content.” They wrote them as **wisdom-transfer** — a way to compress a lifetime into something their kids could inherit.

That clicked with me because it describes how I think about learning:

- I’m not collecting knowledge for status.
- I’m building a library of models and skills that can be passed forward.
- I want my growth to become her leverage.

And I didn’t just think about it abstractly. We did real things together:
- shared routines,
- shared English practice (Cambly),
- trips that create memory, not just achievement:
  - **Białka Tatrzańska (Hotel Bania)**,
  - a week in the mountains at **Nosalowy Dwór**.

This is not a footnote. It’s the mission layer.

---

## Social: not absent — in combat mode
To be precise: I had plenty of human interaction in 2025.

But much of it was **transactional / adversarial / high-stakes**:
- negotiations,
- conflicts,
- procedural pressure.

That is social interaction, but it does not build:
- network effects,
- goodwill,
- optionality,
- long-horizon relationships.

It’s social in “combat mode,” not social in “growth mode.”

---

## The cost (and the diagnosis)

Here is the most precise diagnosis I got this year:

> **I am addicted to intensity as proof of value.**

Intensity becomes evidence that I matter.  
If I push hard, I feel “earned.”

This is powerful — and dangerous — because it creates chronic overreach:
- too many “hard” weeks,
- cognitive performance drops from overload,
- body signals ignored until they become loud.

But there’s an even deeper pattern.

This wasn’t just “imbalance.”  
This was **systematic avoidance** of domains that don’t give immediate, measurable feedback:

- Physical pushing → immediate feedback (pain, PR, Garmin metrics).
- AI/books → immediate feedback (understanding, notes, output).
- High-stakes negotiations → immediate feedback (response, outcome, next move).
- Social initiation → delayed/uncertain feedback, risk of rejection.
- Spiritual practice → almost zero measurable feedback.

**Pattern:** I optimized for **control + immediate measurement**.  
Anything requiring patience, uncertainty, dependence on others, or a long time horizon without clear metrics quietly fell out of the system.

That’s why the three brutal baseline numbers matter. They convert “diagnosis” into data.

---

## 2026: constraints, not goals

I’m not writing a list of aspirations.

I’m setting constraints — because constraints shape behavior.

### Constraint #1: Physical governance
If intensity is addictive, the fix is governance.
- Max **2 hard sessions/week**
- Deload cycles are mandatory
- No “pyrrhic PRs”

### Constraint #2: Social floor (hygiene)
Not “networking someday.”  
A repeatable rule that rebuilds initiation and tolerance for uncertainty.

### Constraint #3: Spiritual cadence (small but real)
Not one intense month.  
A micro-cadence that survives low motivation and high workload.

### Constraint #4: Family time as dedicated blocks
Presence requires structure.  
If it’s not scheduled, it gets crowded out by everything that produces instant metrics.

---

## Closing
2025 proved I can build a year like a machine.

But it also exposed my shadow:
- intensity as proof of worth,
- control as comfort,
- avoidance of uncertain feedback loops (social/spiritual).

That’s not shame. It’s data.

If 2025 was the year of Jim Rohn and LLMs as mentors,  
then 2026 must be the year of **governance**, **relationships**, and **long-horizon practice** — the domains that don’t flatter me with instant metrics, but determine the real trajectory.

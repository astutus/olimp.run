### Part III — How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking

#### Principle 1 — You Can’t Win an Argument

Carnegie opens this part with a brutal but honest idea:

> **The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.**

He anchors it in a story that likely burned itself into his episodic memory.  
At a social gathering, someone misquoted Shakespeare. Carnegie knew the quote was wrong and pressed to correct him.  
The other man wouldn’t let go, so Carnegie proposed they ask a mutual friend who knew Shakespeare inside out.

They turned to him.  
The friend listened, then calmly sided with the other man — and kicked Carnegie under the table.

On the way home, Carnegie asked: *“Why did you do that?”*  
His friend replied with something like a life equation:

> “What good would it have done to prove him wrong?  
> Would it have made him like you?  
> What would you really gain?”

That’s the key shift: not *“Who is right?”* but *“What is this worth?”*

Carnegie concludes that in **9 out of 10 arguments**, both sides walk away more convinced of their own position than before.  
You don’t change minds — you harden them. And even if you “win,” you still lose: score the point, lose the person.

Benjamin Franklin saw the same thing. He could win debates — the victories were empty.  
The other person left humiliated, not persuaded.

Recently I had a situation that genuinely got under my skin.  
First instinct: replay it and prove (to myself) how right I was.  
After listening to Carnegie, I realised this is exactly the kind of moment to practice a different response: not a failure, but an opportunity to build skill.  
Instead of wishing it hadn’t happened, I can treat it as training — stay calm, avoid the bait, protect the relationship.  
That lines up perfectly with Jim Rohn:

> *“Don’t wish for fewer problems. Wish for more skills.”*

The argument isn’t the problem. The question is: **do I use this moment to build skill, or feed my ego?**

> **Principle 1:** *To get the best of an argument — avoid it.*

#### Principle 2 — Show Respect for the Other Person’s Opinions. Never Say, “You’re Wrong.”

Left alone, people sometimes change their own minds.  
The moment you say *“you’re wrong”*, pride locks the door.

Respect isn’t surrendering your view; it’s **not insulting theirs**.  
Trade labels (*“that’s dumb”, “that’s illogical”*) for curiosity: *“Walk me through how you’re seeing it.”*  
When you need to disagree, soften the entry:

> “It seems to me… but I may be wrong — I’ve been wrong before.”

Two tactics that help:
1) **Acknowledge what’s true** in their point (bridge, not battle).  
2) **Correct with humility** (lower the emotional shield first).

Roosevelt supposedly said he’d be thrilled to be right **70%** of the time.  
Effectiveness with humans beats infallibility on paper.

#### Principle 3 — If You Are Wrong, Admit It Quickly and Emphatically.

When someone needs to feel powerful, give them something real to be gracious about.  
Own it early and fully; you remove the oxygen from conflict.

Handy lines:
- “You’re right — I missed that. Thanks for catching it.”  
- “I moved too fast here. Let me fix it.”

When criticized in writing and you don’t want to escalate, try:
> “I appreciate the pushback. I’m actually less certain than I was yesterday — happy to compare notes when useful.”

It’s not weakness. It’s **control through responsibility**.

#### Principle 4 — Begin in a Friendly Way.

If someone’s heart is full of bitterness, **no amount of logic will move them**.  
So begin where logic can’t go: tone.

Name **common ground** and **shared aims**:
- “We both want this shipped without risk.”  
- “We’re on the same side of the customer.”

Offer facts as *considerations*, not verdicts.  
Daniel Webster’s courtroom habit is gold:
> “Here are a few facts worth keeping in view…”  
> “With your experience in human nature, you’ll see what matters here.”

Invite; don’t corner.

#### Principle 5 — Get the Other Person Saying “Yes, Yes” Immediately

This is one of Carnegie’s most powerful — and underrated — techniques. And once you see it, it becomes obvious.

Socrates used it over 2,000 years ago: before diving into a difficult topic, he would lead his opponent through a series of small, undeniable questions — all of which invited a simple answer: “Yes.”

Why does it work?

Because "No" shuts the body and mind down. The moment someone says "No," their pride, biology, and ego rush to defend it — even if they start doubting it inside.

But when a person says a few “Yeses” in a row, something shifts. The tension softens. You’re no longer seen as a threat — you’re part of the same side.

This isn’t manipulation. It’s a way to keep conversations from turning into ego battles — and turn them into actual connection.

Carnegie’s advice? Don’t start with where you disagree — start with where you already agree. Values. Goals. Shared ground. Stack small “yes” questions early — and only later lead into your proposal.

Because by that point, your idea won’t feel like a challenge — it’ll feel like the natural next step.

> **Principle 5:** *Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately.*

#### Principle 6 — Let the Other Person Feel That the Idea Is Theirs

This one hit uncomfortably close.

Carnegie points out something most of us don’t want to admit:  
Even our **friends** would rather talk about *their* wins than listen to us list ours.  
And *if even friends feel that way*, what do you think strangers feel?

It stung, because I could immediately think of moments where I did the opposite.  
Moments where someone shared something and I felt the need to add my own result — not to brag, but because I was proud.  
Still… pride isn’t always connection.  
And Carnegie makes it painfully clear: even good people can be repelled by someone else’s self-congratulation.

Then came the quote that sealed it:

> “If you want enemies, be better than your friends.  
> If you want friends, let your friends be better than you.”

Luckily, I don’t have that hunger to dominate.  
I *want* friends who are better than me — they raise my bar.  
But I also know I sometimes share too much, too fast.  
Carnegie’s advice is brutally simple: **talk about your own wins only when people ask.**

Let others speak.  
Let them take the lead.  
Let them shine.

That’s the shift. And that’s the work.

> **Principle 6:** *Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.*

### Part III — How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking

#### Principle 1 — You Can’t Win an Argument

Carnegie opens this part with a brutal but honest idea:

> **The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.**

He anchors it in a story that likely burned itself into his episodic memory.  
At a social gathering, someone misquoted Shakespeare. Carnegie knew the quote was wrong and pressed to correct him.  
The other man wouldn’t let go, so Carnegie proposed they ask a mutual friend who knew Shakespeare inside out.

They turned to him.  
The friend listened, then calmly sided with the other man — and kicked Carnegie under the table.

On the way home, Carnegie asked: *“Why did you do that?”*  
His friend replied with something like a life equation:

> “What good would it have done to prove him wrong?  
> Would it have made him like you?  
> What would you really gain?”

That’s the key shift: not *“Who is right?”* but *“What is this worth?”*

Carnegie concludes that in **9 out of 10 arguments**, both sides walk away more convinced of their own position than before.  
You don’t change minds — you harden them. And even if you “win,” you still lose: score the point, lose the person.

Benjamin Franklin saw the same thing. He could win debates — the victories were empty.  
The other person left humiliated, not persuaded.

Recently I had a situation that genuinely got under my skin.  
First instinct: replay it and prove (to myself) how right I was.  
After listening to Carnegie, I realised this is exactly the kind of moment to practice a different response: not a failure, but an opportunity to build skill.  
Instead of wishing it hadn’t happened, I can treat it as training — stay calm, avoid the bait, protect the relationship.  
That lines up perfectly with Jim Rohn:

> *“Don’t wish for fewer problems. Wish for more skills.”*

The argument isn’t the problem. The question is: **do I use this moment to build skill, or feed my ego?**

> **Principle 1:** *To get the best of an argument — avoid it.*

#### Principle 2 — Show Respect for the Other Person’s Opinions. Never Say, “You’re Wrong.”

Left alone, people sometimes change their own minds.  
The moment you say *“you’re wrong”*, pride locks the door.

Respect isn’t surrendering your view; it’s **not insulting theirs**.  
Trade labels (*“that’s dumb”, “that’s illogical”*) for curiosity: *“Walk me through how you’re seeing it.”*  
When you need to disagree, soften the entry:

> “It seems to me… but I may be wrong — I’ve been wrong before.”

Two tactics that help:
1) **Acknowledge what’s true** in their point (bridge, not battle).  
2) **Correct with humility** (lower the emotional shield first).

Roosevelt supposedly said he’d be thrilled to be right **70%** of the time.  
Effectiveness with humans beats infallibility on paper.

#### Principle 3 — If You Are Wrong, Admit It Quickly and Emphatically.

When someone needs to feel powerful, give them something real to be gracious about.  
Own it early and fully; you remove the oxygen from conflict.

Handy lines:
- “You’re right — I missed that. Thanks for catching it.”  
- “I moved too fast here. Let me fix it.”

When criticized in writing and you don’t want to escalate, try:
> “I appreciate the pushback. I’m actually less certain than I was yesterday — happy to compare notes when useful.”

It’s not weakness. It’s **control through responsibility**.

#### Principle 4 — Begin in a Friendly Way.

If someone’s heart is full of bitterness, **no amount of logic will move them**.  
So begin where logic can’t go: tone.

Name **common ground** and **shared aims**:
- “We both want this shipped without risk.”  
- “We’re on the same side of the customer.”

Offer facts as *considerations*, not verdicts.  
Daniel Webster’s courtroom habit is gold:
> “Here are a few facts worth keeping in view…”  
> “With your experience in human nature, you’ll see what matters here.”

Invite; don’t corner.

#### Principle 5 — Get the Other Person Saying “Yes, Yes” Immediately.

Socrates stacked small, undeniable **agreements** until the conclusion felt self-evident.  
Don’t start where you differ. Start where you already agree, then progress in short steps.

Pattern:
1. “We both want X.” — **Yes.**  
2. “And we agree Y would put X at risk.” — **Yes.**  
3. “So testing Z before rollout protects X without slowing us down.” — **Yes.**

One “No” hardens identity; many small “Yes”es relax it.  
You’re not trapping — you’re **building a path they helped pave**.

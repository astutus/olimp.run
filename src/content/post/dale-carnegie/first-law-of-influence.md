I picked up Dale Carnegie’s *How to Win Friends and Influence People* after feeling quite disappointed with another book, [*Mastery* by Robert Greene](/posts/mastery-greene/).  
Yet that disappointment did its job — it turned my attention toward **social intelligence** and **emotional understanding**, and that’s how I ended up with a truly valuable book in my hands.

I listened to Carnegie’s book once in full, and then decided to go through it again, this time slowly — with notes, reflections, and a focus on practice.  
Jim Rohn first inspired me to keep a **personal journal**, but now this idea evolved into something broader — a **social intelligence journal**. Carnegie and Franklin both analyzed their relationships daily, learning from each interaction. That hit me hard: wisdom grows not from memory, but from reflection.

The **first part of Carnegie’s philosophy** is built on one powerful principle:

> **Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.**

It’s the foundation.  
Criticism rarely changes people — it triggers defense and justification. Even the worst criminals considered themselves righteous. Carnegie quotes examples like Al Capone and prisoners from the Cincinnati penitentiary, who all had elaborate rationalizations for their actions.  

A few lines stayed with me:

- “Criticism, like homing pigeons, always returns home.”  
- Lincoln reminded: *“Judge not, that ye be not judged.”*  
- Franklin vowed: *“I will speak ill of no man and speak all the good I know of everybody.”*  
- And finally: even God doesn’t judge man until the end of his days — so who are we to judge others?

Skinner later confirmed in behavioral science what Carnegie already knew intuitively:  
**Reward works better than punishment.** Criticism doesn’t reform — it hardens. Praise, patience, and empathy open doors.

People aren’t driven by logic; they’re driven by **emotion and self-justification**.  
To influence others, you don’t need sharper arguments — you need deeper understanding.

This is just the beginning of the journey — the first law of influence.

# Optimizing Learning: Strategizing for a Brain Like Mine

## 🧠 Intro: Cognitive Optimization Starts with Awareness

I believe growth needs to be balanced — physical, intellectual, and spiritual.
In this piece, I focus on the intellectual: optimizing how I think, learn, and remember.

It’s a systems-level reflection: How does my brain work? What slows it down? What amplifies it?
This is my exploration of optimizing learning, memory, and strategy — based not on trends, but on self-observation and hard-earned insight.

## 🧪 Key Concepts I Had to Learn First

Before getting personal, I needed theory — to understand where my learning system was failing, and why. Here’s the core:

* **Spacing Effect & Spaced Repetition:** The foundation of effective long-term memory. I now understand why repeating at increasing intervals works, and how tools like Anki use algorithms based on Ebbinghaus’ forgetting curve.
* **Cognitive Load Theory:** Split into intrinsic (complexity), extraneous (distractions), and germane (deep learning processes). I now recognize how distractions or poor strategy overload my working memory.
* **Working Memory Capacity:** Most people can hold 3–5 chunks. I tested mine — 3 is solid, 4 doable, 5 is chaos. People deceive themselves with hacks — I aim for honesty.
* **Generation & Depth Effects:** You remember more when you *generate* info, not just review. The deeper you process it — with meaning, connection, questions — the better.
* **Desirable Difficulty:** Learning must feel slightly hard. If it’s too easy, it doesn’t stick.
* **Expertise Reversal Effect:** What helps novices can hurt experts. It’s a key reason experienced learners should avoid overly guided material.

Now — let’s go personal.

## 🔍 Discoveries About My Brain and Learning Style

### Episodic vs Semantic Memory

My hippocampus is a beast. I remember conversations, places, moments. But names, terms, labels? Weak. Likely a sign of left inferior temporal cortex inefficiency.
My memory builds internal maps: I remember *where* an idea was in a book, *when* I read it, and *why* it stuck. I attach data to emotion, time, context. That’s the key.

### Working Memory: Honest Self-Diagnosis

I did chunking tests. 3–4? Solid. 5? Overload. But I also saw how I cheat — phonetic tricks, emotional anchors. Some people claim “I can hold 7!” but it’s illusion. I strive to measure *clean* capacity.

### Semantizing for Survival

My brain *rejects* meaningless info. It refuses to store it. But if I give it meaning — a sentence, analogy, memory — it clings to it for years. This isn’t a learning style. It’s survival architecture.

### Speed Reading? Not for Me

I considered a course. Almost joined. But user feedback (“works, but exhausting”) and my own pace showed me: not my path. My strength is depth. Slow means solid.

### Grepping, Not Hoarding

I don’t collect pretty notes. I grep while reading. I process live. Making notes without processing is pointless. During postgrad lectures, I barely wrote — I preferred dialogue and live analysis.

### Text Beats Audio (Usually)

I like audiobooks — *Duhigg* works well. *Kahneman*, *Taleb*? No chance. If something requires deeper reasoning — engaging *System 2* (as defined by Kahneman) — then text is a better interface. I need to re-read, pause, scribble, reflect. That’s how my mind processes.

### RAM Can’t Grow, But Can Be Optimized

No, I can’t add more working memory slots. But I *can* chunk better, organize better, switch better. Music may optimize flow — but it won’t magically add RAM. Mozart myths? Likely chunking mastery.

### Mnemonics: Last-Resort Tool

I used to hate them. Felt like polluting my brain with fake meaning. Still, I now see: they’re a *card in the deck*. Emergency use only — for high-stakes recall under time pressure.

(And yeah — I used to admire Jim Kwik’s memory tricks. Today? Respectful smile. It’s a show. Not a path.)

### Deep Encoding: My Tools

* Sentence-making
* Feynman technique
* Analogy & speculation
* 5 Whys
* Self-made questions

It’s not about technique. It’s about *depth*.

### Activation Energy: The Real Enemy

Environment doesn’t matter. I can study in my flat, a mall, a prison. But if I lack a plan — the energy cost to begin *kills me*. I stall. Planning = ignition.

### Expertise Reversal in Action

I’ve seen it many times: strong players stuck at FIDE master level, coaching kids for decades. The same material that helps kids may trap the coach. This theory explains why.

## 💡 Project Idea: Pipek Dręczyciel 3.0

An old project — originally written in Perl, later rebuilt in Java. Time to bring it back.

* An adaptive spaced repetition engine
* Personalized to my actual forgetting curve, not Ebbinghaus’ average
* Including multi-form questions, trust-but-verify answers
* Based on input, not just statistics

Let’s make a learning tool that *learns* me.

## 🧭 Takeaways

I don’t mimic anymore. I don’t chase popular methods. I respect my brain’s wiring.

I’m not a student. I’m a general — with soldiers waiting for orders.

Now I know:

* What works
* What blocks me
* What to cut
* Where to invest

And that’s power.

# Optimizing Learning: Strategizing for a Brain Like Mine

## 🧠 Intro: Cognitive Optimization Starts with Awareness

I believe growth needs to be balanced — physical, intellectual, and spiritual.  
In this piece, I focus on the intellectual: optimizing how I think, learn, and remember.

It’s a systems-level reflection: How does my brain work? What slows it down? What amplifies it?  
This is my exploration of optimizing learning, memory, and strategy — based not on trends, but on self-observation and hard-earned insight.

## 🧪 Key Concepts I Had to Learn First

Before getting personal, I needed theory — to understand where my learning system was failing, and why. Here’s the core:

* **Spacing Effect & Spaced Repetition:** The foundation of effective long-term memory. I now understand why repeating at increasing intervals works, and how tools like Anki use algorithms based on Ebbinghaus’ forgetting curve.
* **Cognitive Load Theory:** Split into intrinsic (complexity), extraneous (distractions), and germane (deep learning processes). I now recognize how distractions or poor strategy overload my working memory.
* **Working Memory Capacity:** Most people can hold 3–5 chunks. I tested mine — 3 is solid, 4 doable, 5 is chaos. People deceive themselves with hacks — I aim for honesty.
* **Generation & Depth Effects:** You remember more when you *generate* info, not just review. The deeper you process it — with meaning, connection, questions — the better.
* **Desirable Difficulty:** Learning must feel slightly hard. If it’s too easy, it doesn’t stick.
* **Expertise Reversal Effect:** What helps novices can hurt experts. I watch this closely when teaching chess to kids.

Now — let’s go personal.

## 🔍 Discoveries About My Brain and Learning Style

### 🔹1. Episodic vs Semantic Memory

My hippocampus is a beast. I remember conversations, places, moments. But names, terms, labels? Weak. Likely a sign of left inferior temporal cortex inefficiency. Solution? Always attach new data to stories, emotion, and context.

### 🔹2. Working Memory: Honest Self-Diagnosis

I did chunking tests. 3–4? Solid. 5? Overload. But I also saw how I cheat — phonetic tricks, emotional anchors. Some people claim “I can hold 7!” but it’s illusion. I strive to measure *clean* capacity.

### 🔹3. Semantizing for Survival

My brain *rejects* meaningless info. It refuses to store it. But if I give it meaning — a sentence, analogy, memory — it clings to it for years. This isn’t a learning style. It’s survival architecture.

### 🔹4. Speed Reading? Not for Me

I considered a course. Almost joined. But user feedback (“works, but exhausting”) and my own pace showed me: not my path. My strength is depth. Slow means solid.

### 🔹5. Grepping, Not Hoarding

I don’t collect pretty notes. I grep while reading. I process live. Making notes without processing is pointless. During postgrad lectures, I barely wrote — I preferred dialogue and live analysis.

### 🔹6. Text Beats Audio (Usually)

I like audiobooks — *Duhigg* works well. *Kahneman*, *Taleb*? No chance. I need an interface I can reread, pause, highlight. Not because I’m a visual learner — but because text is the better UI for *my brain*.

### 🔹7. RAM Can’t Grow, But Can Be Optimized

No, I can’t add more working memory slots. But I *can* chunk better, organize better, switch better. Music may optimize flow — but it won’t magically add RAM. Mozart myths? Likely chunking mastery.

### 🔹8. Mnemonics: Last-Resort Tool

I used to hate them. Felt like polluting my brain with fake meaning. Still, I now see: they’re a *card in the deck*. Emergency use only — for high-stakes recall under time pressure.

### 🔹9. Deep Encoding: My Tools

* Sentence-making  
* Feynman technique  
* Analogy & speculation  
* 5 Whys  
* Self-made questions  

It’s not about technique. It’s about *depth*.

### 🔹10. Activation Energy: The Real Enemy

Environment doesn’t matter. I can study in my flat, a mall, a prison. But if I lack a plan — the energy cost to begin *kills me*. I stall. Planning = ignition.

### 🔹11. Expertise Reversal in Action

Teaching kids chess at Step 1 while I’m at Step 3? Sometimes harms me. Too much time “below my level” dulls my own progress. Waitzkin was right: higher-level learners need less instruction, more silence.

### 🔹12. Jim Kwik Syndrome

I once watched his memory shows with awe. Now? I smile. Impressive, but not my path. Tricks are not systems.

## 💡 Project Idea: Pipek Dręczyciel 3.0

An old Perl project — now reborn. Pipek could become:

* An adaptive spaced repetition engine  
* Personalized to my actual forgetting curve, not Ebbinghaus’ average  
* Including multi-form questions, trust-but-verify answers  
* Based on input, not just statistics  

Let’s make a learning tool that *learns* me.

## 🧭 Takeaways

I don’t mimic anymore. I don’t chase popular methods. I respect my brain’s wiring.

I’m not a student. I’m a general — with soldiers waiting for orders.

Now I know:

* What works  
* What blocks me  
* What to cut  
* Where to invest  

And that’s power.

## 🎯 The Final Test – May 28, 2025

After 17 weeks, I completed the final race of the **Garmin Coach 5K Adaptive Training Plan**.

- 🕐 **Time:** 21:50  
- 📉 **Pace:** 4:21 / km  
- 🫀 **Average HR:** 181 (down from 187 in my previous peak cycle)  
- 💥 **Effort rating:** 9/10 – something I’ve only ever marked twice before.

### Splits & HR:
- 1 km – 4:21 / HR 173  
- 2 km – 4:22 / HR 182  
- 3 km – 4:22 / HR 184  
- 4 km – 4:23 / HR 185 (minor wall)  
- 5 km – 4:18 / HR 185 – strong finish, 150m sprint

It was **my 100th run in the plan**, and it broke my previous 5K record by **8 seconds**.  
Small progress? Maybe. But hard-earned.

## 📈 The Bigger Picture – What This Plan Really Was

This was not just a plan — it was a **grind**.  
From Feb 5 to May 28, I ran:

- 🏃‍♂️ **100 runs**
- 📏 **699.7 kilometers**
- 🧠 **Average HR: 146 bpm**
- 🧱 A full base built brick by brick.

At the same time, I was also following **Calimove Advanced** — a demanding strength program.  
Eventually, I shifted to a **10-day microcycle** for Calimove instead of 7 days, because the combination of long runs, VO2max efforts, and high-volume work was simply too much.

Despite that? **I never overtrained.**  
Unlike in 2024, I didn’t feel smashed or drained. Quite the opposite — I felt powerful and under control.

## ⚙️ Pragmatism Over Prestige

I run 5Ks not because they’re easy — but because they’re **efficient**. I have limited time. I want results.  
I’m not chasing marathons. That mindset often leads to testosterone crashes, chronic fatigue, and false pride.

Long runs of 15–17 km? I disliked them, but I completed them.  
The 10+ km sessions? Frequent and heavy.  
The fatigue? Constant. **Fresh legs were a rare luxury.**

This plan pushed volume relentlessly — partly due to a setup mistake.  
The system asked when I was available to run… I checked every day.  
As a result: **almost daily running**. Brutal.

## ✅ What Worked

- **Truly adaptive** – adjusted for flights, illness, and under-recovery.
- **Resilient engine** – I now cruise through long runs without issue.
- **Aerobic base built** – slow paces, low HR, smooth efforts.
- I ran on hilly terrain with 2–3 inclines — not structured hill sprints, but it helped fill the gap.
- I had a **full-blown cold during the PEAK phase**, and still kept going — my body shut it down fast.

---

## ❌ What Didn’t

- Sprinting and uphill runs were completely missing.  
  I ran hills occasionally, but they were **not structured efforts** — a major gap in the plan.
- **Pace alerts** made me overtrain early on:  
  base runs became tempo, tempo became threshold, threshold became VO2max.  
  I fixed that from Week 2 in the Build phase.
- Volume was just too high for freshness. Most days, I felt heavy-legged.

---

## 🧪 Physiological Gains

- **Resting HR** dropped from 44 → 40 bpm, with several days at **my lifetime best: 39**.
- **HRV** consistently hit **120–130**, peaking at **138** on two occasions — a new high.
- These gains weren’t random — I really **took care of recovery**:
  - Smart supplementation  
  - High-quality diet  
  - Sleep optimization  
  - Low-stress daily structure

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

This cycle wasn’t designed to be “fun.”  
It was about **discipline**, **volume**, and **surviving with intelligence**.

- I didn’t skip.  
- I didn’t burn out.  
- I didn’t follow my ego into injury.  
I followed **structure**, watched **signals**, and respected **adaptation**.

I might revisit this plan — but only at 3x/week. That way, I keep the benefits without the wear.

> **The final time doesn’t matter.  
> What matters is that I finished 100 runs knowing exactly why.**

**Book II marks the real beginning of Aurelius’ internal philosophy.**  
Gone are the formalities — this is where the reflection starts. Calm, deliberate, and at times, strikingly honest.

### What stayed with me:

- **Every day, expect difficult people.**  
  People driven by ignorance, not evil — vanity, greed, dishonesty.  
  Aurelius says: *don’t be surprised, and don’t let it affect you*.  
  There’s clarity in preparing your mind for the world as it is.

- **Don’t argue with relatives.**  
  He says it simply — and there’s wisdom in that.  
  Often, it’s better to let go than to chase righteousness in circles.

- **The body is not the self.**  
  He speaks of it as earth, as decay — and elevates reason and will.  
  What struck me was his urgency: *use your mind while it’s still sharp*.  
  With age, physical decline is expected — but mental sharpness also fades.  
  That moment when your cognition still fires: it’s precious.

- **He holds reverence for the divine, but in a naturalistic way.**  
  Less about gods, more about **the order and logic of nature**.  
  There’s discipline in aligning yourself with it — rather than resisting it.

- **Live each day as if it’s your last.**  
  Not in a reckless sense — but in presence and precision.  
  Don’t waste moments. Make them count.

- **Desire-driven errors are worse than those from anger.**  
  Because desire is cold and calculated. It’s a willful corruption.  
  That felt deeply relevant.

- **Death is not to be feared.**  
  You only lose the time you actually lived — not the future you never had.  
  That thought stayed with me. It reframes loss entirely.

- **Goodness as a recurring theme.**  
  Not as virtue signaling — but as service.  
  He saw goodness as acting in harmony with reason and for others.  
  Quiet, public-spirited, principle-driven.

**Key passage that stayed with me:**

> *“Even if you were destined to live three thousand years, remember: you lose only the life you are living. The longest and shortest lives amount to the same — the present is all we ever possess.”*

It reads almost like a logical proof.  
**You can’t lose what you never had.**  
And the future is never yours until it’s lived.

**Takeaway from Book II:**  
You don’t control the world, but you do control your stance.  
Live presently. Act justly. Stay aligned.  
Everything else — distraction.

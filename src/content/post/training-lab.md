## 🧪 The Experiment – Post-Season Rebuild

Context:  
From mid-July to late October 2025 I ran a hard 5K block (Garmin Coach Amy), finished the season healthy and with a PR, but with clear signs that **the system was running on credit**:

- great race result, HR down to 39 bpm at peak, HRV up to ~140,
- but also: long-term low libido, suppressed DHEA-S, chronic stress, very high cognitive load (work + Berkeley),
- classic picture of “**performance OK, but HPA axis overcooked**”.

So instead of rolling straight into another “hero” cycle, I’m running a **deliberate rebuild block**:

> 4 weeks of **2× full-body gym + 3× Z2 runs**,  
> low CNS stress, high movement quality, and strict HR/HRV monitoring.

This post replaces the old “Amy’s 5K + Calisthenics Base” lab and documents the **Rebuild Phase** I’m using as a bridge into the next training year.

# Section 1: Principles & Assumptions

### Training priorities

- **Health of the system first**: HPA axis, sleep, libido, HR/HRV stability.
- **Strength as support**, not as a new stress sport.
- **Running = easy base only** (Z2), no tempos, no intervals.
- **Cognitive load is real** – work + study count as stress.

### Strength block rules

- **2× full-body sessions per week** (A/B split).
- **Main compounds** (front squat, RDL, bench, OHP, pulldown/row):
  - 2 sets × 6–8 reps  
  - **RIR 3–4** (RPE ~6–7) → you *feel* the set, but could do 3–4 clean reps more.
- **Accessories** (curls, glute band work, wall sit, core):
  - 2 sets × 10–12 reps or 30–60 s  
  - **RIR 4–5** (RPE ~5–6).

> Goal: **rebuild strength & patterns** with minimal CNS taxation, not chase PRs.

### Running block rules

- **3× Z2 runs per week**.
- HR cap: **≤130 bpm** (slightly flexible if terrain forces small spikes).
- **No intensity**: no thresholds, no VO₂max, no strides for now.
- Duration:
  - Minimum 30 minutes (Daniels’ “true easy run” threshold),
  - Weekly volume held for **3–4 weeks before any increase** (Daniels’ “no 10% per week creep”).

### Monitoring & autoregulation

Use **HR, HRV, and subjective feeling** as guardrails:

- If:
  - HR stays ~41–42 bpm,
  - HRV ≥110 and stable or slowly rising,
  - sleep solid, no brain fog, no anxiety spikes,
  
  → it’s OK to progress weights slightly or extend runs according to plan.

- If:
  - HR jumps +3–4 bpm and stays there,
  - HRV drops into 90–100 and doesn’t bounce back,
  - sleep worsens, mental fatigue returns,

  → **freeze progression** (or even step back a week) in both gym and running.

# Section 2: Weekly Structure

Typical week during the rebuild block:

- **Mon** – Strength A (full body)
- **Tue** – Z2 run (30–40 min, HR ≤130)
- **Wed** – Mobility / GoWOD, walking, no strength
- **Thu** – Strength B (full body)
- **Fri** – Z2 run
- **Sat** – OFF / mobility / light walk
- **Sun** – Z2 run

Daily mobility:  
**GoWOD / stretching 10–20 min** – treated as a core part of recovery, not an optional extra.

# Section 4: Running – Base Rebuild

During this block I’m also rebuilding my **easy mileage** after the 5K season.

### Starting point

- Coming into the block:  
  - **3× ~5 km** per week → ~34 min per run, ~100–105 min total.
- Runs feel easy at ~135 bpm, but VO₂max dropped slightly and HRV is still re-normalising after the season and deload.

### Daniels, but adapted

Jack Daniels recommends:

- easy runs **30–150 minutes** (long run at the high end),
- and **holding weekly volume for 3–4 weeks** before increasing, rather than adding 10% every week.

I’m applying the *spirit* of that rule, not the literal “+50% after 4 weeks” from his 10 → 15 miles example.  
Given my context (age, HPA history, cognitive load, new strength block), a **+25–30% jump** in weekly minutes is already a solid stimulus.

### Target weekly structure (Base Rebuild Block 1)

For the next 4 weeks:

- **Run 1:** 5 km (~34 min)
- **Run 2:** 6 km (~41 min)
- **Run 3:** 8 km (~55 min)

That’s:

- **19 km total**,  
- ~130 min of Z2 running per week (**+25–30%** vs previous ~100 min).

Rules:

- All runs stay in **Z2 (HR ≤130)**.
- No intentional pace goals – effort and HR drive the run, not pace.
- Weekly volume stays at this level for **at least 3–4 weeks**.
- Only if HR/HRV and overall recovery are good, the next block can go to something like:
  - 6 + 6 + 8 km (~20 km) or
  - 5 + 7 + 8 km, still fully easy.

# Section 5: Exit Criteria & Next Steps

At the end of the 4-week Rebuild block I’ll review:

- **Objective:**
  - Resting HR: ideally around **41–42 bpm** (peak was 39, but 41–42 is a healthy steady state).
  - HRV: ideally **≥110** and not trending down.
  - No chronic soreness, no joint pain.

- **Subjective:**
  - Sleep solid (falling asleep easily, few/no awakenings).
  - No brain fog, good mental focus.
  - Mood stable, no “wired but tired” feeling.
  - Legs feel “springy” again on Z2 runs.

If all of that checks out:

- **Strength:**  
  - next block = keep A/B split, but allow **3×6–8 on the main lifts** (front squat, bench, RDL, row/pulldown),
  - accessories stay 2×10–12.

- **Running:**  
  - maintain or slightly extend weekly minutes (e.g. to ~140–150 min),
  - only then start thinking about re-introducing small doses of quality (strides / light tempos), never at the expense of recovery markers.

If markers degrade:

- freeze progression, cut back volume or intensity, and treat the current block as *the* training load until the system stabilises again.

✅ This “Training Lab” version is no longer about “how much can I stack on top”, but about **how to rebuild a high-functioning system after running it close to the edge** – using strength, Z2 running and real-world stress (work, study) as one integrated picture rather than separate silos.

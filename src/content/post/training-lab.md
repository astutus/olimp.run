I’m starting a new 8-week block on **Feb 1, 2026**.

Context: I just had a “deload week” forced by skiing (28h on slopes, ~240 km). It was not hardcore racing, but it’s still **eccentric quad/glute work** and it counts as real stress. Running is being rebuilt to ~**30 km/week** (4 easy runs), winter conditions included.

It’s a **mobile-friendly execution plan** with **exact loads** and **non-negotiable rules** so I don’t “accidentally” drift into heroic stupidity.

## Why this block
- I want strength training back as a stable habit.
- I’m rebuilding without frying the **CNS** or poking **L5/S1**.
- Running stays easy. The goal is consistency and durability, not ego metrics.

## Rules (no exceptions)
- Intensity is controlled by **RIR** (reps in reserve).
  - **RIR 3** = could do 3 more clean reps.
  - **RIR 2** is allowed only in **Week 7 (peak)**, and still **no grinders**.
- If form breaks or speed dies: load is too high. Reduce next session.
- If back pain exceeds **2/10** during squat/hinge: stop that lift and switch to safer variant / machine.
- Running stays at ~30 km/week for Weeks 1–4. **No mileage increase** during the early strength ramp.

## Weekly schedule
- **2× strength sessions / week** (A/B), at least 48h apart.
- **4× easy runs / week**, keep HR mostly **135–145** (winter conditions = accept a bit higher if needed).

# The 8-Week Strength Block (Feb 1 Start)

## Session A (Lower + Bench)
1) Back Squat (high-bar)  
2) Leg Press (45°)  
3) Bench Press  
4) Lat Pulldown  
5) Dead Bug + Plank  
6) Optional: Wall Sit (only if legs feel fresh)

### Session A — exact loads by week

| W4 | **50 kg** 3×9 @RIR3 *(or hold 3×8 if back complains)* | **120 kg** 3×8 @RIR3 | **72.5 kg** 3×6 @RIR3 | +1 step only if 3×10 was clean |
| W5 | **52.5 kg** 3×8 @RIR3 *(only if W4 was perfect)* | **125 kg** 3×8 @RIR3 | **72.5 kg** 3×7 @RIR3 | 3×8–9 @RIR2–3 |
| W6 | **52.5 kg** 3×8–9 @RIR3 *(or hold)* | **130 kg** 3×8 @RIR3 | **72.5 kg** 3×8 @RIR2–3 | 3×9–10 @RIR2–3 |
| W7 (peak) | **55 kg** 3×6–8 @RIR2–3 *(no grind)* | **135 kg** 3×8 @RIR2–3 | **75 kg** 3×6–7 @RIR2–3 | heaviest clean week |
| W8 (deload) | -20% load, **2×8** @RIR5 | -20% load, **2×8** @RIR5 | -20% load, **2×6–8** @RIR5 | -1 step, **2×8** easy |

**Squat technique note (core focus):**
- If bracing feels weak: use **tempo squats** (3s down) for that week and do **not** increase load.

---

## Session B (Lower + Pull + Press + Arms)
1) Bulgarian Split Squat  
2) Hip Thrust  
3) Seated Row  
4) DB Overhead Press  
5) Arms (rotate weekly)  
6) Side Plank + Pallof Press

### Session B — exact loads by week
| Week | Bulgarian Split Squat | Hip Thrust | Seated Row | DB OHP |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| W1 | DB **2×10 kg**, 3×8/leg @RIR3–4 *(or BW if unstable)* | **60 kg** 3×8 @RIR3 | top-minus-1-step 3×8 @RIR2–3 | **16 kg** 3×8 @RIR3 |
| W2 | +1–2 kg/DB if stable | **60 kg** 3×9 @RIR3 | same load, aim 3×9 | **16 kg** 3×9 @RIR3 |
| W3 | small bump again | **60 kg** 3×10 @RIR2–3 | same load, aim 3×10 | **16 kg** 3×10 @RIR2–3 |
| W4 | hold or bump | **65 kg** 3×8 @RIR3 | +1 step only if 3×10 was clean | **18 kg** 3×8 @RIR3 |
| W5 | bump if knees/back ok | **65 kg** 3×9 @RIR3 | 3×8–9 @RIR2–3 | **18 kg** 3×9 @RIR3 |
| W6 | hold | **65 kg** 3×10 @RIR2–3 | 3×9–10 @RIR2–3 | **18 kg** 3×10 @RIR2–3 |
| W7 (peak) | best clean week, still no grind | **70 kg** 3×8 @RIR2–3 | heaviest clean week | **20 kg** 3×6–8 @RIR2–3 *(only if shoulders feel perfect)* |
| W8 (deload) | -20%, **2×8** easy | -20%, **2×8** easy | -1 step, **2×8** easy | -20%, **2×8** easy |

## DB Press (assistance only)
DB press stays as **technique/control + extra stimulus**, not a main lift.

- Put it in **Session B** after DB OHP (or swap order if shoulders prefer it).
- **2×8** only, @RIR4, slow + controlled.

**DB press targets**
- W1: **22–24 kg** 2×8  
- W2: **24 kg** 2×8  
- W3: **26 kg** 2×8  
- W4: **26 kg** 2×8  
- W5: **28 kg** 2×8 *(only if clean and shoulders 0/10)*  
- W6–W7: hold or test **30 kg** 2×8 only if it stays controlled  
- W8: deload

---

## Hinge work (back-safe RDL replacement)
Bilateral RDL stays out. It already caused a back “postrzał”.

**Single-leg RDL**
- Start: **2×8/leg @ 8 kg DB** (current)  
- Progression over the block: **8 → 10 → 12 kg** (only if back stays 0–1/10)

If balance annoys me: use a **kickstand RDL** (rear toe lightly on floor).

---

## Arms: Hammer vs Supinated Curl (exact plan)
I’m not doing heavy hammer curls twice a week. That’s how elbows get stupid.

**Rotation**
- Odd weeks: **Hammer Curl**
- Even weeks: **Supinated DB Curl** (harder, usually lighter load)

**Hammer Curl**
- W1: **16 kg** 3×8 @RIR3  
- W3: **18 kg** 3×8 (only if form stays strict)  
- W5+: **20 kg** allowed only if strict (no swinging)

**Supinated DB Curl**
- W2: **14 kg** 3×8–10 @RIR3  
- W4: **16 kg** 3×8 @RIR3  
- W6–W7: **16–18 kg** depending on control

Optional swap: supinated DB curl → **EZ-bar curl** 3×8 @RIR3.

---

## “When ready” checkpoints (to avoid self-sabotage)
By **Week 3**, if recovery is fine, I’m “when ready” for:
- Squat: **50 kg 3×8**
- Bench: **70 kg 3×8**
- Leg press: **115 kg 3×8**

No hero moves needed. That’s simply returning to controlled, repeatable work.

---

## Monitoring (simple and useful)
I track trends, not single-day noise:
- **RHR** 7-day average
- **HRV** 7-day average
- Subjective: sleep continuity, mood, back pain, soreness >48h

If markers drift badly: cut next session to **2 sets** on squat + bench and keep everything @RIR4–5.

---

## Running note (current)
I’m holding ~**30 km/week**: **7, 7, 7, 9 km** (easy), winter conditions.  
Goal is to keep it boring and sustainable while this strength block runs.

---

That’s the plan. The point is not to “surprise the body”. The point is to remove ambiguity so I can execute.

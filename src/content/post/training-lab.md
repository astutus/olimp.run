## 🧪 The Experiment

Starting June 16, 2025: An 8-week synchronized training block addressing all systems. Commander's approach - strategic, not grinding.

---

# Section 1: Running - Strategic Build

## 🎯 The Context – Where I'm Starting

After completing 100 runs and 700km in the Garmin Coach Adaptive plan, I'm taking a strategic pivot. Two weeks of deload revealed some important signals:

- **RHR climbed**: 40 → 42 bpm
- **HRV dropped**: 120-130 → 112
- **Base HR drifting**: Used to hold 146 bpm @5:45/km, now drifts to 155 after 1-2km
- **Missing pieces**: Zero structured sprints or hills for 17 weeks
- **The cost**: Testosterone took a hit from volume (libido = best biomarker)

Time for the commander to make decisions, not just execute.

## 🏗️ Training Zones (LTHR: 175, Max HR: 190)

- **Z1**: 105-140 bpm (Recovery/Walk)
- **Z2**: 142-150 bpm (Base)

**Strategy**:
- Full warm-up: 20min progressive + 4x100m strides
- Race: Negative split (start @4:25/km, finish @4:15/km)
- Target HR: 180-187 (like previous PR efforts)

## 🚨 Critical Execution Rules

### Warm-up Non-Negotiables
- **Minimum times**: 10min for tempo, 15min for threshold, 20min for VO2max
- **Strides**: Always 80-90% effort, never 100%
- **Ready signals**: HR responds normally, slight sweat, legs feel light

### Recovery Protocols
- **Between sprints/hills**: Always walk (full CNS reset)
- **Between VO2max**: Slow jog or walk @Z1
- **Between threshold**: Light jog @Z1 (130-140)
- **Walk breaks**: Strategic tool, not weakness

### Weekly Monitoring
**Green lights (proceed as planned):**
- Morning HRV >110
- RHR <42
- Legs feel springy after warm-up

**Yellow lights (modify intensity):**
- HRV 100-110
- RHR 42-44
- Legs heavy but loosening up

**Red lights (recovery day only):**
- HRV <100
- RHR >45
- HR won't enter target zone
- Any pain (not normal fatigue)

### Volume Progression
- Weeks 1-2: ~20-22km (restart phase)
- Weeks 3-4: ~24-26km (building phase)
- Weeks 5-6: ~28-30km (peak volume)
- Weeks 7-8: ~30-32km (with race taper)

## 💪 Supporting Elements

### Daily Requirements
- **Mobility**: 10min every evening (non-negotiable)
- **Sleep**: 8h minimum during VO2max weeks
- **Hydration**: Track color, not volume

### Post-Workout Protocols
- **After sprints/hills**: Cold shower on legs (2-3min)
- **After threshold/tempo**: 10min walk + static stretching
- **After VO2max**: 15min walk + legs up wall 5min

### Nutrition Focus
- **Pre-hard sessions**: Light carbs 2h before
- **Post-hard sessions**: Protein within 30min
- **Daily**: Maintain 2900kcal to support testosterone recovery

## 📊 Expected Adaptations

### By Week 4:
- RHR trending back toward 40
- HRV consistently >115
- Base pace HR stabilizing
- Sprint power returning

### By Week 8:
- RHR ≤40 bpm
- HRV >120 consistently
- Base pace @5:45 holds at HR 146
- Can hit 180+ HR without destruction
- Testosterone recovered (libido normalized)
- 5K pace feels controlled, not desperate

## 🎯 Decision Points Post-Cycle

**If hit sub-21:50 + feel good:**
- New Garmin Adaptive @3x/week
- Focus on 10K next

**If close but exhausted:**
- Repeat weeks 5-8 with 10% less volume
- Add swimming for recovery

**If feeling incredible:**
- Greg McMillan advanced plan
- Push toward sub-21:00

**If any injury signals:**
- Full stop
- 2 weeks swimming/mobility only
- Reassess with sports medicine

# Section 2: Calisthenics - Strength & Skill Focus

## 🎯 Context & Goals

After 3+ months of Calimove Advanced (Level 3), time for strategic shift:
- **Groin injury**: Requires complete rest from L-sit variations and hollow body work
- **Volume fatigue**: Moving from 9x9 grinding to quality strength work
- **New focus**: Muscle-up progression and handstand development
- **Smart loading**: 5x5-6 with reserve, adding weight progressively

## 🏗️ Weekly Structure

- **Monday**: Strength A
- **Wednesday**: Technique/Muscle-up

## 📝 Key Notes

1. **Groin injury**: If anything hurts - STOP. No "pushing through"
2. **Progression**: Add weight/difficulty only when previous week felt easy
3. **Muscle-up**: Technique > strength. Don't rush
4. **Core**: McGill, Bird Dog, Pallof, Side Plank are your friends
5. **Handstand**: Additional 5-10 min daily practice if feeling good
6. **Recovery**: Weekend = rest or MAX 20 min light technique

## 🚨 Red Flags - Stop if:
- Groin pain intensifies
- Feel "tearing" with any movement
- L5/S1 pain appears
- Extreme fatigue (remember 3x/week running!)

---

# Section 3: Mobility - Consistency is Key

## 🎯 The Approach

Continuing with Calimove Mobility 2.0 every other day. Progress in mobility is subtle and cumulative - the goal is consistency, not intensity. Adding McGill's Big 3 to each session for spine hygiene and core stability without aggravating the groin injury.

**Current status**: Maintaining the routine, building slowly toward better movement quality.

---

## 🧠 Integration Philosophy

This 8-week block represents the evolution from soldier to commander:
- **Symbiosis**: Three training modalities supporting each other
- **Strategic loading**: Quality over quantity in every domain
- **Injury respect**: Working around limitations, not through them
- **Hormonal health**: Total stress management across all activities

The body should be a capable tool, not a broken specialist.

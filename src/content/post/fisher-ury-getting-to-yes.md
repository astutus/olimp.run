I’m reading (and re-thinking) *Getting to Yes* by Roger Fisher and William Ury. The book is famous for sounding like common sense — until you apply it when you’re tired, emotionally activated, and the other side is playing hardball.

What I like most: it doesn’t try to turn you into a “hard negotiator.” It gives you a structure that lets you stay calm while keeping firm boundaries.

## Everyone negotiates (even if they hate the word)

Fisher & Ury start with a simple claim: everyone negotiates — with partners, kids, colleagues, vendors, institutions.

Most people, however, believe there are only two styles:

- **Soft**: preserve the relationship, avoid conflict, make concessions.
- **Hard**: push, demand, anchor, and outlast.

And yes — in classic **positional bargaining**, *hard typically dominates soft*. Soft negotiators often “win peace” and later pay with resentment.

## Negotiations happen on two levels

Here is the meta-point that matters in real life:

1. **Substance (merit)** — money, scope, deadlines, terms.
2. **The game (process / meta-game)** — what rules we’re using: positional arm-wrestling or problem-solving.

Most people negotiate only on Level 1. Fisher & Ury argue you should also negotiate Level 2 — and when needed, change the game.

## The alternative to positional bargaining: principled negotiation

Their proposed game is **principled negotiation** (also framed as negotiation “on the merits”). It has four pillars:

1. **Separate the people from the problem**
2. **Focus on interests, not positions**
3. **Invent options for mutual gain**
4. **Insist on objective criteria**

The mindset: *participants solve a shared problem together.*

A key phrase that finally clicked for me:

> Be **soft on people**, **hard on the problem**.

“Soft/hard” is not about personality. It’s about **tone vs boundaries**:

- Soft on people = respectful, non-accusatory, emotionally regulated.
- Hard on the problem = clear constraints, criteria, and walk-away lines.

## The time structure: Analysis → Planning → Discussion

Another piece I already did intuitively (now I can run it as a checklist):

- **Analysis**: what’s really going on? what are the constraints and interests?
- **Planning**: what do I want, what can I trade, what are my options?
- **Discussion**: the conversation itself — execution under pressure.

When you’re tired, structure beats willpower.

---

# Pillar 1: Separate the people from the problem

Fisher & Ury emphasize that negotiators are human. Ignore the human layer and the whole thing can collapse.

They highlight two kinds of interests that run in parallel:

- **Substantive interests** (merit)
- **Relationship interests** (how we treat each other, long-term cooperation)

In long-term relationships, relationship interests often dominate.

The tricky part: we tend to **entangle** substance with relationship psychology. A comment about numbers becomes a story about intent, respect, and identity.

They propose treating “people problems” through three lenses:

- **Perception**
- **Emotion**
- **Communication**

## Perception: stop negotiating against your own assumptions

People routinely infer intent from incomplete signals. We turn interpretations into “facts.”

Useful reminders:

- Don’t infer *their* intent from *your* fears.
- Don’t blame them for *your* problems.
- Discuss mutual perceptions explicitly.

A practical move: do something that violates their expectation.

Example: if they expect confrontation, show up calm, polite, and structured. It’s a **pattern interrupt** that often de-escalates the room.

### Give them participation (ownership)

If you want someone invested in a solution, let them co-create it:

- ask for constraints (“What is procedurally possible on your side?”)
- ask for criteria (“What would you need to justify this internally?”)
- ask for advice (“Which option is easiest to defend formally?”)

This is not surrender; it’s creating **ownership**.

### Face-saving (keeping dignity intact)

People resist solutions that make them look weak, wrong, or humiliated.

Your proposal must fit their value system — especially with institutions or formal roles.

---

## Emotion: recognize identity triggers

They suggest paying attention to identity-level interests:

- **autonomy**
- **recognition**
- **belonging**
- **role**
- **status**

In my experience, role/status is massive with formal decision-makers.

### Don’t hide emotion — acknowledge it strategically

“Talking about emotion” doesn’t mean emotional dumping.

It means controlled disclosure:

- say what you feel as data
- then immediately anchor to process and criteria

Example:

> “I’m under stress because this matter is important. That’s why I prepared options and objective criteria so we can stay factual.”

Also: don’t react impulsively to emotional outbursts. Let the pressure vent, then return to the problem.

---

## Communication: three common failures

1) People speak “to the audience” (performance) instead of to each other.  
2) People don’t hear because they’re rehearsing their response.  
3) People misunderstand — often not because of language, but because of **different definitions**.

### Tools that actually work

- **Active listening**: paraphrase + confirm.
- Speak to be understood: one thought per sentence, reduce ambiguity.
- Speak about yourself, not as a diagnosis of them.

Example:

- “You’re discriminating against me.” (diagnosis)
- “I feel treated unfairly / disadvantaged by this process.” (I-statement)

### Talk to achieve an objective

Over-communication is a tax.

A great example of self-sabotage:

If someone offers me 20k for my car and I say:

> “I’d be willing to sell for 15k.”

I just revealed my reservation value and created a negotiation problem out of a solved deal.

Rule: if a sentence does not move toward your goal, don’t say it.

# My summary: prevention beats confrontation

The most underrated prevention:

- build enough relationship to cooperate
- keep the human layer clean
- fight the problem, not the person

This isn’t “being nice.” It’s a disciplined way to keep negotiation from degrading into ego battles.

## Practical micro-checklist (when tired)

**Analysis**
- What do *I* want (interests)?
- What do *they* likely want (interests)?
- What constraints exist?

**Planning**
- objective criteria (2–3)
- options (A/B)

**Discussion**
- paraphrase + confirm
- define terms (“What does ‘not possible’ mean exactly?”)
- say less; ask better questions

If I had to compress the entire approach into one line:

> Don’t win the arm-wrestling. Change the game — with structure, criteria, and disciplined communication.

## Pillar 2: Focus on interests, not positions

The second pillar sounds like a slogan until you notice how often people argue about *what* they want (positions) while ignoring *why* they want it (interests).

- **Position** = a stated demand (“180/m²”, “I want the window closed”, “I won’t pay retroactively”).
- **Interest** = the underlying need, constraint, fear, or goal that makes that position feel necessary (comfort, risk, predictability, budget limits, precedent, autonomy, etc.).

The famous “library window” example works because the fight is framed as two incompatible positions (open vs closed), while the real interests are not symmetrical: one person wants fresh air, the other wants to avoid a draft. Once you drop to interests, you can expand the solution space (open another window, move seats, adjust airflow). The conflict was never “open vs closed” — it was “air vs draft.”

### The non-magical truth: sometimes it *is* just a price fight

It’s important not to romanticize this principle. In a pure single-issue negotiation (e.g., one-time transaction, one variable, no relationship, no scope/time/risk dimensions), “interests” can collapse into a boring tautology:

- Seller’s interest: more money.
- Buyer’s interest: less money.

In a true fixed-pie situation, focusing on interests won’t invent value out of thin air. It won’t replace leverage, alternatives, or constraints.

However, the point is not that interests always create agreement. The point is that **positions are a low-resolution model of what’s going on**. When you search for interests, you often discover hidden variables — and that’s where agreements become possible.

### Behind opposing positions, there are usually mixed interests

Fisher & Ury emphasize that behind opposing positions you can find:

- **shared interests** (both want efficiency, predictability, closure, a stable working relationship, reputation, time savings)
- **compatible interests** (each values different things, so trades become possible)
- **conflicting interests** (often real, but not always the only axis)

The practical value: instead of treating negotiation as “who outlasts who,” you start treating it as “what are the constraints and what can we trade without breaking them.”

### How to identify interests (without therapy language)

A useful method is to ask two questions:

1) **“Why?”**  
   What is driving this position? What problem is the position trying to solve?

2) **“Why not?”**  
   What makes the alternative unacceptable? What risk, constraint, or precedent blocks it?

You can do this internally (analysis) or explicitly (discussion). The key is to keep it neutral and concrete. Instead of challenging a number or a demand directly, you map the reasoning behind it.

Once interests are visible, you can also formulate your own in a way that’s easier to accept:

- be **specific** (vague interests sound like manipulation)
- show they are **reasonable** (a neutral observer could understand them)
- explain them as **constraints** (what makes a proposal workable or unworkable)

### A subtle but powerful move: state the problem before you state the answer

A pattern Fisher & Ury keep pushing is:

- don’t jump to “here is what I want”
- start with “here is the problem we are solving, and here are the constraints”

This shifts the conversation from positional combat to joint problem definition. It is also a clean way to introduce your interests without sounding self-serving.

### Future-oriented framing beats blame

Another useful reminder: focus forward. In many conflicts, people argue about causes (“you did X”), but negotiation is about outcomes (“we need Y”). Moving from positions to interests naturally forces this shift:

- from justification (“because you…”)  
- to objective (“so that we can…”)

### The bridge that makes “interests” actionable: soft on people, hard on the problem

This is the line Fisher & Ury keep forcing for a reason:

> Be **soft on people**, **hard on the problem**.

Without it, “focus on interests” easily turns into either:
- **softness everywhere** (you understand everyone, then you concede), or
- **hardness everywhere** (you diagnose interests, then you weaponize them).

The point is to split *tone* from *stance*.

#### What “soft on people” actually means (and what it does NOT)

Soft on people is not being agreeable or “nice.”  
It means you avoid converting a substantive disagreement into an identity conflict.

Practically:
- don’t speculate about intent (no mind-reading)
- don’t moralize (“you’re unfair,” “you’re greedy,” “you don’t care”)
- don’t diagnose emotions as facts (“you’re angry,” “you’re insecure”)

Instead, treat the other person as a legitimate participant with constraints — even if their position is annoying.

Softness is in the **temperature**:
- respectful language
- curiosity
- letting them save face
- active listening (paraphrase + confirmation)

#### What “hard on the problem” means

Hard on the problem means you are firm on:
- your **interests** (what must be true for a deal to work)
- your **constraints** (time, budget, risk, feasibility)
- your **process standards** (clarity of scope, definitions, criteria)

Notice: “hard” is not aimed at the person. It is aimed at *reality*.

This is where “interests over positions” becomes more than a slogan:
- You can be flexible on *positions* (how the deal is shaped)
- while being inflexible on *interests* (what must be protected)

#### The clean operational model: low temperature, high standards

A simple rule I’m stealing for future negotiations:

- **Low temperature** with people
- **High standards** on the problem

This creates a paradox that often helps cooperation:
the more you insist on clarity and constraints, the more important it becomes to be calm and respectful, so it doesn’t turn into an ego fight.

#### How to reconcile firmness with respect (language patterns)

A few patterns that keep you hard on the problem without attacking people:

- **Acknowledge → constrain → propose**
  - “I understand why this matters to you. My constraint is X. Given that, here are two options…”

- **Separate intent from impact**
  - “I’m not assuming bad intent. The impact of this proposal is Y for me, which makes it unworkable. Let’s adjust the structure.”

- **Define the problem before stating the answer**
  - “If the goal is to achieve A while staying within constraints B and C, then the solution can’t be D. We need an option that satisfies B and C.”

These moves keep the relationship intact while keeping the negotiation anchored in interests, constraints, and objective reality — not personality and pride.

#### Why this is the “unique” part

Many negotiation frameworks either teach assertiveness (hard) or empathy (soft). Fisher & Ury’s distinctive move is insisting that you can — and should — do both simultaneously, but aimed at different targets:

- empathy aimed at **people**
- rigor aimed at **the problem**

Once you internalize this split, “interests vs positions” stops being abstract.
It becomes a disciplined way to fight for your interests without making the other side your enemy.

### My takeaway

“Interests over positions” is not a magic key. It’s a **diagnostic tool** and a **solution generator**:

- If the negotiation is truly single-issue and fixed-pie, interests won’t save you.
- If there are hidden variables (risk, scope, time, process, reputation, precedent), interests reveal them.
- Once interests are explicit, you can craft options and criteria that are harder to dismiss as “just your demand.”

In short:

> Positions shrink the world to a fight.  
> Interests expand it back into a problem you can actually solve.

## Pillar 3: Invent options for mutual gain

This pillar is where *Getting to Yes* stops being a philosophy and becomes a practical skill.

Fisher & Ury use the “split the pie” metaphor: people assume there isn’t a way to divide outcomes so that both sides feel satisfied. They argue the opposite: the ability to **create options** that generate value for both sides is one of the most useful assets a negotiator can have.

The core idea is simple:

> Before you try to split value, try to **create** value.

### Why this feels “impossible” (the four barriers)

They diagnose four predictable barriers that block option-creation:

1) **Premature judgment**  
   Evaluating ideas too early kills creativity. Under pressure, people default to defending their position rather than generating possibilities. In the middle of a tense negotiation, it is unlikely you will suddenly produce a brilliant alternative on the spot — more likely you will either freeze or say something dumb.

2) **Searching for the single best answer**  
   Many people don’t treat “inventing options” as part of negotiation at all. They think the job is to narrow the gap between positions, not to expand the set of possible solutions.

3) **Assuming a fixed pie**  
   The default assumption is that negotiation is zero-sum: one side wins exactly what the other side loses. That mindset forces “either/or” thinking and collapses creativity.

4) **Thinking their problem is their problem**  
   People focus on their own interests and forget a brutal truth: a proposal is useless if the other side cannot accept it. A workable option must speak to both sides’ interests and constraints.

### The “recipe” (what to do instead)

Fisher & Ury propose a practical counter-method:

1) **Separate inventing from deciding**  
   Generate options first; evaluate later. Mixing creation and judgment ensures you generate too few options.

2) **Expand the options on the table**  
   Don’t search for one perfect solution. Treat negotiation like any real decision process: you need multiple alternatives to choose from.

3) **Look for mutual gains**  
   Search for value-creating trades rather than pure concessions.

4) **Make it easy for the other side to decide**  
   Your job is not to hand them a problem. Your job is to hand them a decision they can accept with minimal pain and risk.

---

## 1) Separate inventing from deciding (brainstorming, with guardrails)

Their primary tool is **brainstorming**, ideally with others. You generate many ideas first, without critique, and only later switch into evaluation mode.

They note you *can* brainstorm with the other side — but that comes with risk: you may reveal information you don’t want to reveal, or accidentally anchor the discussion in the wrong direction. In practice, brainstorming is often safer as an internal step, before you bring options to the table.

The key principle stands:

> Creativity requires temporary protection from judgment.

---

## 2) Expand your options (avoid the “single-answer” trap)

Options are not a luxury; they are the difference between being trapped and having room to maneuver.

Instead of asking “What is the best answer?”, force yourself to ask:

> “What are at least 5–10 ways this could be solved?”

Fisher & Ury treat the negotiation table as a place where you should arrive with **choice**, not with one fragile proposal.

### The “swing” between the specific and the general (the circular diagram)

A central method they propose is generating more options by moving back and forth between **specific** and **general** thinking. The diagram is essentially a loop of four thinking modes:

1) **Start with the concrete problem**  
   Describe the current situation you are dissatisfied with.

2) **Move to descriptive analysis (diagnosis) using general categories**  
   Label what type of problem this is and what is causing it. You divide the mess into categories (legal, operational, relationship, financial, etc.) and form working hypotheses.

3) **Move to general approaches (theory-driven solution classes)**  
   Based on diagnosis, you search for broad solution patterns that *tend* to work for that kind of problem.

4) **Return to concrete, actionable proposals**  
   Translate general approaches into specific next steps: who does what, when, and how.

Then you loop again — using one good idea to generate the next ones.

This is the practical value of the model:

> One decent option becomes a generator for more options.

### Other option-expansion techniques

Fisher & Ury add several additional ways to multiply ideas:

- **Look through different professional lenses**  
  Imagine how different disciplines (law, finance, engineering, operations, psychology) would frame the same problem and what solutions they would suggest.

- **Design agreements of different strength**  
  Don’t think only in “full agreement or nothing.” Create weaker versions you can live with if the ideal deal is out of reach. And if you can’t reach substantive agreement, aim at minimum for agreement on *what you disagree about* (clarifying the dispute itself can be progress).

- **Change the scope (scale) of the proposed agreement**  
  Break the problem into smaller parts, or restructure it into more manageable components. Smaller problems are often more solvable, and partial agreements reduce friction.

---

## 3) Look for mutual gains (they are often hidden)

Mutual gains are rarely obvious. They can be buried under positions and under the assumption of a fixed pie.

The move is to search for differences in what each side values.

A classic illustration: two sisters fight over an orange. If you stay at the positional level (“I want the orange”), you split it in half and both lose. If you ask about interests, you discover one wants the fruit and the other wants the peel — and the agreement becomes easy because they want different things.

The takeaway:

> Mutual gain usually comes from allocating resources according to different interests, not from splitting them evenly.

When you find potential mutual gains, name them explicitly. They become fuel for collaboration and a reason for both sides to keep searching.

---

## 4) Make it easy for them to decide (reduce their decision pain)

This section is deceptively important.

A proposal can be attractive on paper and still be rejected because accepting it is costly for the other side — socially, procedurally, politically, or psychologically.

Fisher & Ury suggest “wearing their shoes” deliberately:
- imagine a specific person on the other side
- ask what decision they are being asked to make
- ask what they fear will happen if they accept it
- ask how they could be criticized afterwards

The goal:

> Present them with a decision that is as low-pain as possible.

### Don’t hand them a problem; hand them a justified option

They note a common dynamic:

If you put pressure on the other side to propose something “acceptable,” they may offer a number or a term that is safe for them. Then you treat it as the start of bargaining — and they feel punished for making the first move. This feeds defensiveness and stalls progress.

A better approach is to shape proposals so they feel **justifiable**:
- fair
- lawful
- honorable
- consistent

They point to **precedent** as especially powerful. People want to be consistent, and precedent gives them a ready-made defense: “this isn’t arbitrary.”

They also recommend thinking about what the other side is afraid of, and designing offers (not threats) that minimize those fears — including fear of later criticism for accepting your proposal.

---

## My takeaway

Pillar 3 is not “be creative.” It is a disciplined process:

- protect idea generation from early judgment  
- generate multiple options using a specific↔general loop  
- search for trades based on different values and interests  
- and then package proposals so the other side can say “yes” without getting hurt

In other words:

> Expand the space of solutions — and reduce the cost of choosing one.

# You (Only Faster): McMillan's Training System

## Why study training

Jim Rohn's idea applies here: if you want results, study the craft — don't leave it to chance. I spend hundreds of hours per year training. Treating that as "just go run" is laziness with a Garmin.

So I'm doing the obvious thing I avoided for years: studying training systematically. Right now that means two books in parallel — Jack Daniels' *Running Formula* and Greg McMillan's *You (Only Faster)*. This post covers McMillan.

## The core problem McMillan attacks

Running is simple. Training *looks* complicated because there are too many plans and too many confident opinions.

McMillan's starting point is blunt: distance running is not one-size-fits-all. The "right plan" depends on individual traits:
- experience and injury risk
- response to different workouts
- recovery speed
- adaptation rate (how quickly you get fit from a given stimulus)
- time and life constraints

Generic plans can work "to a point", but they fail whenever your body doesn't match the plan's assumptions.

## Personal Running Evaluation (PRE)

PRE is McMillan's tool to stop blindly following a plan and start *running the plan*. It's three questions that force real self-knowledge:

1. **How do I respond to training?**
2. **How do I recover from training and racing?**
3. **How do I adapt to different types of training?**

This is not motivational fluff. It's a debugging model. If a workout keeps going badly, PRE asks: is it because it's a weak zone for you, because your recovery is too slow for the schedule, or because you need a different distribution/timing of that stimulus?

### Response: types, strengths, weaknesses

McMillan uses a coarse but useful classification:
- **Speedster**
- **Endurance Monster**
- **Combo Runner** (with a speed or endurance bias)

The point is not the label. The point is operational: which workouts are **ST** (strength) and which are **WK** (weakness). Then you mark your plan accordingly.

### Recovery: recovery rate trumps the calendar

This is the line I underlined twice.

Most runners schedule training based on the week layout ("Tuesday speed, Thursday tempo"). McMillan's argument:
- different workouts produce different recovery costs
- different runners recover at different rates
- and those rates change over time

So you classify workouts in your own history as **quick recovery** or **long recovery**. Then you space hard work based on *your actual recovery*, not the template's calendar.

His example of a runner whose tempo sessions became inconsistent after age 45 — not because tempo suddenly became a weakness, but because speedwork recovery slowed — is a clean illustration: the calendar stayed the same, biology changed.

### Adaptation: fast vs slow adapting zones

McMillan separates two often-confused things:
- **adaptation rate**: how quickly you get a noticeable fitness boost from a zone
- **adaptation extent**: how much improvement is available in that zone before returns flatten

Operationally:
- some zones "click" after only a few sessions (fast adapting)
- others need more exposures and earlier placement in the cycle (slow adapting)

This directly supports planning: slow-adapting work tends to be scheduled earlier and repeated more; fast-adapting work is used more sparingly and placed closer to race day.

This is how you stop peaking at the wrong time: you stop treating all workouts as interchangeable "hard days".

### ST/WK labeling: fixing the plan

A practical exercise I'm stealing:

- Print the plan.
- Mark each specialized workout as **ST** or **WK**.
- Then look for failure patterns: too many WK workouts in a row, WK workouts too close to the race, or "WK + high mileage" stacking at the wrong time.

McMillan's examples show the same template plan becoming two different plans with a few surgical changes: omit a WK element when it clusters badly, swap an end-of-plan confidence-killer for an earlier workout that fits the runner, adjust the final week so it supports the race, not ego.

This is coaching logic, not plan worship.

## Training Phases, Zones, and Workouts

I'm keeping these together on purpose. *Phases* (sequence), *zones* (physiology), and *workouts* (execution) are one system. Splitting them would be like separating TCP from congestion control: possible, but it breaks the mental model.

### Training phases: why they exist

The core idea is simple:

> **"Do the training so you can do the training."**

Race-specific work is potent but expensive. Phases exist to make you capable of absorbing that cost without getting injured or burned out.

McMillan's phase taxonomy:

**1) Basic fitness phases (preparation)**

1. **Injury Resistance** — Non-running work: strength, mobility, tissue capacity (tendons/ligaments/bones), general robustness.
2. **New Runner** — Introductory structure: learning effort/pace, form cues, gentle quality.
3. **Mileage Base** — Building weekly volume toward a personal "sweet spot."
4. **Workout Base** (Lydiard vibe) — Aerobic work plus foundational quality: leg speed, aerobic threshold/steady-state, long runs.
5. **Prep – Hills** — Conditioning the legs and tissues for the stress of faster running.
6. **Prep – Speed** (Rosa vibe) — Developing speed before entering a stamina-heavy block (e.g., marathon training).
7. **Prep – Stamina** — Developing stamina before a speed-oriented block (e.g., 5K/10K).

**2) Race-specific phase**

Typically the final 5–8 weeks. The goal is to train the specific demands and limitations of the target race.

**3) Peak phase**

Last 1–2 weeks. Balancing freshness with a small amount of sharpening. Too much = fatigue. Too little = flatness.

For me, the non-negotiable insight is this: phases are not a moral requirement. They're a *readiness ladder*. If I'm not ready for the next rung, the calendar doesn't get a vote.

### Mileage: sweet spot, not ego

McMillan's mileage take is refreshingly non-dogmatic.

Most coaches classify runners by weekly mileage. McMillan argues **days/week** and **time-on-feet** often matter more than raw distance, because mileage is a function of pace.

He also emphasizes the idea of **a sweet spot**: enough volume to drive adaptation, not so much that injury risk and fatigue accumulate. And critically: your sweet spot is not static. It shifts with experience (often up), age (often down), and life stress (high stress → lower sustainable mileage).

This framing replaces moralizing ("run more") with engineering ("what load can I sustain repeatedly without breaking?").

### Race pace relativity

This is one of the most practical concepts in the book.

If a plan says **5 × 1 mile at 5K pace**:
- A 15:00 5K runner does ~24 minutes of hard running total.
- A 30:00 5K runner does ~50 minutes of hard running total.

Same written workout. Completely different physiological load.

A better prescription is time-based, e.g.: **5 × 5 minutes at 15-minute race pace** with **2 minutes easy**. Now the training stimulus is comparable across abilities.

### The four training zones

McMillan maps training intensity into four zones, defined by time-based race pace:

1. **Endurance** — easy aerobic work; low lactate; conversational effort.
2. **Stamina** — threshold territory; "comfortably hard"; lactate/ventilation thresholds live here.
3. **Speed** — VO2max-focused work; high stress; limited frequency.
4. **Sprint** — neuromuscular + lactic tolerance; short, controlled, high quality.

He uses six variables to define them: effort, ventilation (breathing), pace, heart rate, VO2, and lactate. In real training you mainly control effort + breathing + pace, with HR as a secondary check.

**No Man's Land**

Endurance and Stamina do **not** touch. The gap is the classic "gray zone": effort rises, fatigue cost rises, but the adaptation is not proportional.

In practice: if your "easy" drifts too fast for too long, you live in this middle zone and recovery starts to fail over weeks.

My translation: if I'm "easy-running" with clearly elevated breathing/HR, I'm leaking into no man's land and paying for it later.

### Workouts per zone

**Endurance zone workouts**

McMillan splits Endurance work into three distinct intentions:

- **Recovery runs (recovery jogs):** very easy; purely to promote blood flow and tissue recovery. Typical duration: 15–45 minutes.
- **Long runs:** time-on-feet; durability and aerobic depth; steady effort, no hero pace. Typical duration: ~90–240 minutes.
- **Easy runs:** the bulk of training; build/maintain aerobic base and running economy.

**Stamina zone workouts**

Stamina training sits around critical thresholds (lactate/ventilatory):

- **Steady-state runs:** the underused workhorse; medium effort, long duration; extremely effective.
- **Tempo runs:** continuous threshold effort ("comfortably hard"); rhythm and control.
- **Tempo intervals:** threshold broken into longer repeats with short recoveries.
- **Cruise intervals:** shorter threshold repeats with short jog recoveries. The trap: turning them into speedwork by going too fast.

**Speed zone workouts**

- **VO2max intervals:** repeats 1–6 minutes; goal is 10–30 minutes total time at VO2max; recovery jog roughly ½ to 1× the repeat duration.

Key warning: VO2max intervals are among the most stressful workouts for the musculoskeletal system. "More" is rarely better here.

**Sprint zone workouts**

McMillan splits Sprint into two distinct goals:

- **Lactic acid tolerance intervals:** repeats 30–70 seconds; recovery long (often 2–5× repeat time); flood the system, clear it, repeat.
- **Neuromuscular (leg speed) strides:** repeats 10–30 seconds; recovery 30–90 seconds; coordination, relaxed speed, clean mechanics. These should not become "heavy breathing" workouts.

### Why this classification matters (personal)

This solved a problem I kept creating for myself: I was running "Speed" workouts at repeat-level pace and repeat-level pain, with Speed-style recovery.

Result: race-like stress, multi-day fatigue, HRV down, cycle dead.

The fix is embarrassingly simple: if the goal is Speed, I respect Speed constraints. If the goal is Sprint, I keep it neuromuscular-clean. If the goal is Stamina, I don't drift into Speed.

## The McMillan Running Calculator

The Calculator is McMillan's tool for translating a recent race result into (a) equivalent race predictions at other distances and (b) precise training paces for each zone and workout type.

**How it works (theory)**

Unlike Daniels' VDOT (which is VO2max-driven), McMillan's calculator uses **lactate threshold pace** as the primary physiological parameter. His argument: lactate threshold has been shown to be the most important determinant of distance running performance.

The other key difference: most prediction models (Purdy's RunningTrax, Daniels' Oxygen Power) fit all data to one equation applied across all distances. McMillan uses **proximity weighting** — your half-marathon time is a much stronger predictor of marathon time than your 800m time. This creates more accurate predictions for the specific distance you care about.

The calculator provides pace ranges (not single targets) for every workout type. The range accounts for day-to-day variation: if you feel "on," run near the fast end; if sluggish, stay near the slow end. As long as you're in the range, you're training optimally.

McMillan also provides Speedster vs Endurance Monster toggles — slightly different pace ranges for speed/sprint work depending on your runner type.

**Coach's notes from the book:**

- Re-calculate paces every 3–8 weeks as fitness improves.
- If you're easily running faster than the fast end of the range on all runs, update your race time by 1–2%.
- Some athletes are "fast trainers" (always at the fast end), others are "slow trainers" (always at the slow end). Neither is better — they're just different.

### Pace ranges are useful — and still not sufficient

One thing I initially disliked: McMillan often sounds like "stay in the pace range and adaptations will come."

That is directionally true, but incomplete for runners like me: I can turn "easy" into no man's land for weeks without noticing — until HRV drops, resting HR rises, and the whole cycle collapses.

From my McMillan calculator sheet (based on ~21:48 5K), the Endurance paces are:
- **Recovery jog:** 5:43–6:09 /km
- **Long run:** 5:04–5:52 /km
- **Easy run:** 5:00–5:39 /km

If I execute "easy" with bad discipline — e.g., drifting to ~160 bpm because Garmin still shows a friendly green zone — I'm no longer doing Endurance. I'm farming fatigue.

So the rule I'm adopting is blunt:

**Pace is the target. HR + breathing are the governor.**

McMillan himself gives HR guidance inside Endurance work (e.g., recovery runs kept very low). The book isn't anti-HR — it's just pace-first. For my physiology, pace-first without governors becomes self-harm disguised as training.

Practical rules that actually work:
- If pace says "easy" but breathing isn't calm / HR drifts up early → slow down.
- If I'm stacking stress (work, sleep debt) → treat the same pace as a harder zone.
- If I do a hard Speed session → I do not add a Stamina session the same week "because the plan says so."

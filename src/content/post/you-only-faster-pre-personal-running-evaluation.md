# You (Only Faster): McMillan PRE and the End of Blind Training Plans

I’ve wasted enough time “doing training plans” without truly *studying training*.

Jim Rohn’s line keeps coming back to me:

> If you wish to be successful, study success.  
> If you wish to be happy, study happiness.  
> If you wish to be wealthy, study wealth.  
> Don’t leave it to chance — make it a study.

Running is no different. I spend hundreds of hours per year training. Treating that as “just go run and hope” is not discipline — it’s laziness with a Garmin.

So I’m doing the obvious thing I avoided for years: I’m studying the craft. Right now that means two books in parallel:
- Jack Daniels, *Daniels’ Running Formula*
- Greg McMillan, *You (Only Faster)*

This post is a checkpoint: structured notes + my first-pass interpretation. I’m explicitly *not* filtering out ideas that don’t fit my current self-image (“I’m a speed type”, “I’m not built for threshold”, etc.). I’ve been wrong before, and future-me may need these fundamentals either to correct my own training or to advise someone else.

## The core problem McMillan attacks

Running is simple. Training *looks* complicated because there are too many plans and too many confident opinions.

McMillan’s starting point is blunt: distance running is not one-size-fits-all. The “right plan” depends on individual traits:
- experience and injury risk
- response to different workouts
- recovery speed
- adaptation rate (how quickly you get fit from a given stimulus)
- time and life constraints (including the hidden constraint: recovery time)

Generic plans can work “to a point”, but they fail whenever your body doesn’t match the plan’s assumptions.

His solution is a simple system, and the piece that matters most is Step #2:

## PRE — Personal Running Evaluation

PRE is McMillan’s tool to stop blindly following a plan and start *running the plan*.

It’s three questions that force real self-knowledge:

1) **How do I respond to training?**  
2) **How do I recover from training and racing?**  
3) **How do I adapt to different types of training?**

What I like: this is not motivational fluff. It’s a debugging model.

If a workout keeps going badly, PRE asks: is it because it’s a weak zone for you, because your recovery is too slow for the schedule, or because you need a different distribution/timing of that stimulus?

### Response: types, strengths, weaknesses

McMillan uses a coarse but useful classification:
- **Speedster**
- **Endurance Monster**
- **Combo Runner** (with a speed or endurance bias)

The point is not the label. The point is operational:
- which workouts are **ST** (strength)
- which workouts are **WK** (weakness)

Then you mark your plan accordingly.

### Labeling key workouts (ST/WK) and fixing the plan

A practical exercise I’m stealing:

- Print the plan.
- Mark each specialized workout as **ST** or **WK**.
- Then look for failure patterns:
  - too many **WK workouts in a row**
  - **WK workouts too close to the race**
  - or “WK + high mileage” stacking at the wrong time

McMillan’s examples show the same template plan becoming two different plans with a few surgical changes:
- omit a WK element when it clusters badly
- swap an end-of-plan confidence-killer for an earlier workout that fits the runner
- adjust the final week so it supports the race, not ego

This is coaching logic, not plan worship.

## Mileage: “sweet spot” and the real variable

McMillan’s mileage take is refreshingly non-dogmatic.

Most coaches classify runners by weekly mileage. McMillan argues **days/week** and **time-on-feet** often matter more than raw distance, because mileage is a function of pace.

He also emphasizes the idea of **a sweet spot**:
- enough volume to drive adaptation
- not so much that injury risk and fatigue accumulate

And critically: your sweet spot is not static. It shifts with:
- experience (often up)
- age (often down)
- life stress (high stress → lower sustainable mileage)

This framing is useful because it replaces moralizing (“run more”) with engineering (“what load can I sustain repeatedly without breaking?”).

## Recovery: recovery rate should trump the calendar

This is the line I underlined twice.

Most runners schedule training based on the week layout (“Tuesday speed, Thursday tempo”). McMillan’s argument:
- different workouts produce different recovery costs
- different runners recover at different rates
- and those rates change over time

So you classify workouts in your own history as:
- **quick recovery**
- **long recovery**

Then you space hard work based on *your actual recovery*, not the template’s calendar.

His example of a runner whose tempo sessions became inconsistent after age 45 — not because tempo suddenly became a weakness, but because speedwork recovery slowed — is a clean illustration:
the calendar stayed the same, biology changed.

## Adaptation: fast vs slow adapting zones

McMillan separates two often-confused things:
- **adaptation rate**: how quickly you get a noticeable fitness boost from a zone
- **adaptation extent**: how much improvement is available in that zone before returns flatten

Operationally:
- some zones “click” after only a few sessions (fast adapting)
- others need more exposures and earlier placement in the cycle (slow adapting)

This directly supports planning:
- slow-adapting work tends to be scheduled earlier and repeated more
- fast-adapting work is used more sparingly and placed closer to race day

This is how you stop peaking at the wrong time: you stop treating all workouts as interchangeable “hard days”.

## My own early observations (likely to be revised)

This is a first-pass self-assessment using PRE logic. I’m deliberately recording it even if future me corrects it.

### 1) I’m sensitive to intensity stacking

When I execute “hard” sessions too hard, the result is race-like stress:
- recovery blows up for days
- HRV drops, resting HR rises
- and the next “quality day” becomes a failure cascade

This isn’t a heroic badge. It’s a constraint to respect.

### 2) Execution matters more than the workout label

A session can be written as “VO2max intervals”, but if I run them at a pace that turns it into repeats/race effort, it becomes a different workout with a different recovery cost.

Daniels is very explicit about this (e.g., repeats demand longer recovery and are not the same tool as intervals). McMillan’s “recovery rate trumps calendar” implies the same practical conclusion:
if the session costs too much, it was either executed too hard or placed incorrectly.

### 3) “Easy” must actually be easy

One of the most common traps for serious amateurs (including me):
turning easy runs into “moderate” runs.

If most days drift into mid-zone intensity, then even one real hard session per week can eventually break recovery. This is where polarized / 80-20 thinking becomes useful—not as ideology, but as load management.

## Why I’m keeping the fundamentals even if my “type” changes

I’m not writing this as a permanent identity statement (“I’m X type”). McMillan’s own argument is that:
- your profile shifts with experience, age, stress, and training history
- PRE should be re-run before each cycle

So I’m keeping both sides of the model:
- speed-side tools and logic
- endurance/stamina-side tools and logic

Because future-me may need the opposite emphasis, and because coaching someone else requires understanding both.

## What I’m taking forward

The takeaway is not a plan. It’s a control system:

- **PRE before each cycle** (response, recovery, adaptation)
- **ST/WK labeling** to prevent stupid workout clustering
- **sweet spot mileage** instead of mileage ego
- **recovery over calendar**
- **execution discipline** (a workout is what your physiology experienced, not what the plan called it)

This is the difference between “training” and “doing workouts”.

Next: I’ll continue through the book into training zones and pace calculation, and I’ll merge McMillan’s terminology with Daniels’ pacing model so I can execute sessions precisely instead of improvising myself into fatigue.

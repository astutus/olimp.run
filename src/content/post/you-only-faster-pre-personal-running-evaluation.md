# You (Only Faster): McMillan PRE and the End of Blind Training Plans

I’ve wasted enough time “doing training plans” without truly *studying training*.

Jim Rohn’s line keeps coming back to me:

> If you wish to be successful, study success.  
> If you wish to be happy, study happiness.  
> If you wish to be wealthy, study wealth.  
> Don’t leave it to chance — make it a study.

Running is no different. I spend hundreds of hours per year training. Treating that as “just go run and hope” is not discipline — it’s laziness with a Garmin.

So I’m doing the obvious thing I avoided for years: I’m studying the craft. Right now that means two books in parallel:
- Jack Daniels, *Daniels’ Running Formula*
- Greg McMillan, *You (Only Faster)*

This post is a checkpoint: structured notes + my first-pass interpretation. I’m explicitly *not* filtering out ideas that don’t fit my current self-image (“I’m a speed type”, “I’m not built for threshold”, etc.). I’ve been wrong before, and future-me may need these fundamentals either to correct my own training or to advise someone else.

## The core problem McMillan attacks

Running is simple. Training *looks* complicated because there are too many plans and too many confident opinions.

McMillan’s starting point is blunt: distance running is not one-size-fits-all. The “right plan” depends on individual traits:
- experience and injury risk
- response to different workouts
- recovery speed
- adaptation rate (how quickly you get fit from a given stimulus)
- time and life constraints (including the hidden constraint: recovery time)

Generic plans can work “to a point”, but they fail whenever your body doesn’t match the plan’s assumptions.

His solution is a simple system, and the piece that matters most is Step #2:

## PRE — Personal Running Evaluation

PRE is McMillan’s tool to stop blindly following a plan and start *running the plan*.

It’s three questions that force real self-knowledge:

1) **How do I respond to training?**  
2) **How do I recover from training and racing?**  
3) **How do I adapt to different types of training?**

What I like: this is not motivational fluff. It’s a debugging model.

If a workout keeps going badly, PRE asks: is it because it’s a weak zone for you, because your recovery is too slow for the schedule, or because you need a different distribution/timing of that stimulus?

### Response: types, strengths, weaknesses

McMillan uses a coarse but useful classification:
- **Speedster**
- **Endurance Monster**
- **Combo Runner** (with a speed or endurance bias)

The point is not the label. The point is operational:
- which workouts are **ST** (strength)
- which workouts are **WK** (weakness)

Then you mark your plan accordingly.

### Labeling key workouts (ST/WK) and fixing the plan

A practical exercise I’m stealing:

- Print the plan.
- Mark each specialized workout as **ST** or **WK**.
- Then look for failure patterns:
  - too many **WK workouts in a row**
  - **WK workouts too close to the race**
  - or “WK + high mileage” stacking at the wrong time

McMillan’s examples show the same template plan becoming two different plans with a few surgical changes:
- omit a WK element when it clusters badly
- swap an end-of-plan confidence-killer for an earlier workout that fits the runner
- adjust the final week so it supports the race, not ego

This is coaching logic, not plan worship.

## Mileage: “sweet spot” and the real variable

McMillan’s mileage take is refreshingly non-dogmatic.

Most coaches classify runners by weekly mileage. McMillan argues **days/week** and **time-on-feet** often matter more than raw distance, because mileage is a function of pace.

He also emphasizes the idea of **a sweet spot**:
- enough volume to drive adaptation
- not so much that injury risk and fatigue accumulate

And critically: your sweet spot is not static. It shifts with:
- experience (often up)
- age (often down)
- life stress (high stress → lower sustainable mileage)

This framing is useful because it replaces moralizing (“run more”) with engineering (“what load can I sustain repeatedly without breaking?”).

## Recovery: recovery rate should trump the calendar

This is the line I underlined twice.

Most runners schedule training based on the week layout (“Tuesday speed, Thursday tempo”). McMillan’s argument:
- different workouts produce different recovery costs
- different runners recover at different rates
- and those rates change over time

So you classify workouts in your own history as:
- **quick recovery**
- **long recovery**

Then you space hard work based on *your actual recovery*, not the template’s calendar.

His example of a runner whose tempo sessions became inconsistent after age 45 — not because tempo suddenly became a weakness, but because speedwork recovery slowed — is a clean illustration:
the calendar stayed the same, biology changed.

## Adaptation: fast vs slow adapting zones

McMillan separates two often-confused things:
- **adaptation rate**: how quickly you get a noticeable fitness boost from a zone
- **adaptation extent**: how much improvement is available in that zone before returns flatten

Operationally:
- some zones “click” after only a few sessions (fast adapting)
- others need more exposures and earlier placement in the cycle (slow adapting)

This directly supports planning:
- slow-adapting work tends to be scheduled earlier and repeated more
- fast-adapting work is used more sparingly and placed closer to race day

This is how you stop peaking at the wrong time: you stop treating all workouts as interchangeable “hard days”.

## My own early observations (likely to be revised)

This is a first-pass self-assessment using PRE logic. I’m deliberately recording it even if future me corrects it.

### 1) I’m sensitive to intensity stacking

When I execute “hard” sessions too hard, the result is race-like stress:
- recovery blows up for days
- HRV drops, resting HR rises
- and the next “quality day” becomes a failure cascade

This isn’t a heroic badge. It’s a constraint to respect.

### 2) Execution matters more than the workout label

A session can be written as “VO2max intervals”, but if I run them at a pace that turns it into repeats/race effort, it becomes a different workout with a different recovery cost.

Daniels is very explicit about this (e.g., repeats demand longer recovery and are not the same tool as intervals). McMillan’s “recovery rate trumps calendar” implies the same practical conclusion:
if the session costs too much, it was either executed too hard or placed incorrectly.

### 3) “Easy” must actually be easy

One of the most common traps for serious amateurs (including me):
turning easy runs into “moderate” runs.

If most days drift into mid-zone intensity, then even one real hard session per week can eventually break recovery. This is where polarized / 80-20 thinking becomes useful—not as ideology, but as load management.

## Why I’m keeping the fundamentals even if my “type” changes

I’m not writing this as a permanent identity statement (“I’m X type”). McMillan’s own argument is that:
- your profile shifts with experience, age, stress, and training history
- PRE should be re-run before each cycle

So I’m keeping both sides of the model:
- speed-side tools and logic
- endurance/stamina-side tools and logic

Because future-me may need the opposite emphasis, and because coaching someone else requires understanding both.

## Training Phases, Zones, and Workouts (McMillan)

I’m keeping this in the same post on purpose. *Phases* (sequence), *zones* (physiology), and *workouts* (execution) are one system. Splitting them would be like separating TCP from congestion control: possible, but it breaks the mental model.

### Training phases: why they exist

McMillan borrows the classic Lydiard-shaped idea: **build a base, then layer specificity, then taper/peak**. A “phase” is not a prison where you do only one type of work. It’s a **priority** for the block.

The line that matters:

> **“Do the training so you can do the training.”**  
> Sometimes even: **“do the training so you can do the training so you can finally do the training.”**

Translation: if you are not prepared for race-specific work, the plan won’t “make you” — it will just grind you down.

### Two macro-types of phases

#### 1) Basic fitness phases

These weeks exist to build the *capacity* and *durability* required to execute the final race-specific block without breaking recovery.

McMillan’s “modules” (high-level):

1. **Injury Resistance**  
   Non-running work that builds tolerance: strength, mobility, tissue capacity (tendons/ligaments/bones), and general robustness.

2. **New Runner**  
   Introductory structure: learning effort/pace, form cues, gentle quality, quick fitness boost with minimal risk.

3. **Mileage Base**  
   Building weekly volume toward a personal “sweet spot” — consistency over hero mileage.

4. **Workout Base** (Lydiard vibe)  
   Aerobic work plus foundational quality: **leg speed**, **aerobic threshold / steady-state**, and **long runs** to expand endurance.

5. **Prep – Hills**  
   Conditioning the legs and tissues for the stress of faster running.

6. **Prep – Speed** (Rosa vibe)  
   Developing speed before entering a stamina-heavy block (e.g., marathon-style training).

7. **Prep – Stamina**  
   Developing stamina before a speed-oriented block (e.g., 5K/10K), so the later specificity doesn’t destroy recovery.

#### 2) Race-specific phase

This is typically the **final 5–8 weeks** (depends on the event). The goal is to train the specific demands and limitations of the target race.

#### Peak phase (last 1–2 weeks)

Balancing freshness with a small amount of sharpening. Too much = fatigue. Too little = flatness.

## Race pace relativity: why McMillan talks in time, not distance

This is one of the most practical concepts in the book.

If a plan says: **5 × 1 mile at 5K pace**:
- A 15:00 5K runner does ~24 minutes of hard running total.
- A 30:00 5K runner does ~50 minutes of hard running total.

Same written workout. Completely different physiological load.

A better prescription is time-based, e.g.:

- **5 × 5 minutes at 15-minute race pace** with **2 minutes easy**.

Now the training stimulus is comparable across abilities. Distance changes, but the work is the same.

## Four training zones: simple model, strict boundaries

McMillan frames training around four zones named by the benefit:

1. **Endurance**
2. **Stamina**
3. **Speed**
4. **Sprint**

He uses six variables to define them: **effort**, **ventilation** (breathing), **pace**, **heart rate**, **VO2**, and **lactate**.

In real training you mainly control:
- **effort + breathing + pace**, with HR as a secondary check.

### “No Man’s Land”

Endurance and Stamina do **not** touch. The gap is the classic “gray zone”: effort rises, fatigue cost rises, but the adaptation is not proportional.

In practice: if your “easy” drifts too fast for too long, you live in this middle zone and recovery starts to fail over weeks.

---

## Zones → workouts: what belongs where

### Endurance zone: three purposes, three workouts

McMillan splits Endurance work into three distinct intentions:

1) **Recover from hard work** → **Recovery runs/jogs**  
2) **Improve endurance (time on feet)** → **Long runs**  
3) **Build and maintain aerobic base & running economy** → **Easy runs**

**Recovery runs/jogs**
- *Concept:* a slow jog, not a “run”.
- *Purpose:* warm tissues, move blood, deliver rebuilding nutrients — nothing else.
- *Typical duration:* 15–45 minutes (shorter is often better).

**Long runs**
- *Purpose:* endurance, durability, and mental time-on-feet.
- *Key rule:* steady, resist the urge to speed up “to get home”.
- *Typical duration:* ~90–240 minutes, depending on the plan.

**Easy runs**
- *Purpose:* the bulk of aerobic development and maintenance.
- *Common error:* running them too fast until breathing becomes noticeably harder.

### Stamina zone: everything around lactate threshold

Stamina training sits around critical thresholds (lactate/ventilatory). McMillan thinks of it as:
- **below threshold**
- **at threshold**
- **slightly above threshold**

Workouts in this zone:

**Steady-state runs**
- Medium effort, long duration.
- Often overlooked, but extremely effective.

**Tempo runs**
- Continuous work at/near threshold (“comfortably hard”).
- If you’re speed-biased, you generally do better keeping these on the shorter end.

**Tempo intervals**
- Threshold-ish work split into longer repeats with short recoveries.

**Cruise intervals**
- Shorter repeats with short jog recoveries.
- The trap: turning them into speedwork by going too fast.

### Speed zone: VO2max intervals

These are what most runners call “speedwork,” but the target is **aerobic capacity**:
- repeats: **1–6 minutes**
- goal: **10–30 minutes total time at VO2max**
- recovery jog: roughly **½ to 1× the duration** of the fast running (or ~¼ to ½ the distance)

Key warning: VO2max intervals are among the most stressful workouts for the musculoskeletal system. “More” is rarely better here.

### Sprint zone: two distinct sprint goals

McMillan splits Sprint into:

**1) Lactic acid tolerance intervals**
- repeats: **30–70 seconds**
- recovery: **long** (often 2–5× repeat time)
- goal: flood the system, then clear it, repeat

**2) Neuromuscular (leg speed) strides**
- repeats: **10–30 seconds**
- recovery: **30–90 seconds**
- goal: coordination, relaxed speed, clean mechanics
- important: these should not become “heavy breathing” workouts

## Why phases + zones + workouts must stay together

- **Phases** define *when* you prioritize what (sequence).
- **Zones** define *what* stimulus you are applying (physiology).
- **Workouts** define *how* you apply it safely (execution and guardrails).

If those three drift apart, you get the usual pattern:
lots of effort, rising fatigue, inconsistent quality, and a peak that arrives early (or never arrives).

## What I’m taking forward

The takeaway is not a plan. It’s a control system — a way to *own* any plan and stop doing accidental “no man’s land” training.

- **PRE before each cycle** (response, recovery, adaptation)  
  Not for self-labeling vanity (“I’m a Speedster”), but to predict *which sessions are high-cost* for me and where I need guardrails.

- **ST/WK labeling of key workouts**  
  Mark every specialized session as **ST** (fits me) or **WK** (costly). Then fix the plan when it clusters WK sessions or stacks them close to race week.

- **Sweet spot mileage (and a floor/ceiling)**  
  A weekly range that produces progress without triggering injury/HRV drift. Mileage is a dial, not a religion — and it must react to life stress, age, and durability.

- **Phases are sequencing, not dogma**  
  Use phases to answer “do the training so you can do the training.”  
  Basic fitness phases exist to make race-specific work *tolerable and productive* — not to cosplay Lydiard.

- **Zones are physiology, not vibes**  
  Endurance / Stamina / Speed / Sprint are a shared language that prevents category errors (e.g., turning a Stamina workout into a Speed workout because ego).

- **Workouts are execution contracts**  
  Each workout has a purpose *and* constraints (pace range, duration, recovery).  
  If I run the right shape but at the wrong intensity, I did a different workout.

- **Recovery rules the calendar**  
  A session’s *cost* matters more than its label. Hard workouts need spacing based on my recovery rate, not on what a PDF says.

- **Avoid “no man’s land” by default**  
  Easy means easy (endurance HR/effort). Moderate has a target (stamina). Fast has structure (speed/sprint + proper recoveries). The gray zone is where my fatigue quietly compounds.

This is the difference between “training” and “doing workouts”:  
a plan is a template; the control system is what keeps it true.

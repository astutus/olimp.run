During Holy Week, a time traditionally devoted to reflection and renewal, I’ve taken the chance to revisit my own stance toward the Catholic Church — both emotionally and intellectually. It started with a question: **Why am I still Catholic, knowing what I know?**

What followed was a deep conversation — part reflection, part late-night dialogue with a good friend. A friend with insight, honesty, and no fear of asking the hard questions.

## What sets Catholicism apart?

- **Sacramental worldview** – Seeing grace made visible in the material world. Bread, wine, water, oil, the body — all become vessels of God’s presence.
- **Mystical tradition** – A deep contemplative current: Teresa of Ávila, John of the Cross, Brother Lawrence, Meister Eckhart — saints who sought union with God not just in doctrine but in direct experience.
- **Historical continuity** – Through all its mess, Catholicism has preserved an unbroken line of teaching and sacramental life going back to Christ and the Apostles.
- **Universality** – A Church that includes monks and mystics, revolutionaries and rulers, peasants and philosophers — all under one roof.
- **Spiritual tools** – Fasting, confession, spiritual direction, liturgical rhythm, prayer of the hours, the Rosary. We’ve forgotten many of these tools — but they are still ours. Catholicism contains within it a whole system of **ascetic discipline** and **spiritual scaffolding**. Muslims haven’t forgotten theirs. Maybe it’s time we picked ours back up.

## Why does Islamic discipline fascinate me?

- **Clear structure**: Five daily prayers, Ramadan fasting, no alcohol.
- **Communal rhythm**: The Muslim world moves as one — same fast, same prayer, same reverence.
- **No compromise**: For the faithful, God is truly first. Not metaphorically — but tangibly, in time, in choices, in life.

This is what impresses me: discipline with heart. No gap between values and action.

It’s no surprise that someone like **Khabib Nurmagomedov** shines so brightly. His faith is his compass. His strength is his serenity. His example is the message.

> Stoic virtue + Islamic consistency = a figure Aurelius would have admired.

But does that mean Catholics are meant to be lazier? No.

## Catholics have the same tools — we just forgot how to use them

We too have a sacred rhythm:

- The **Liturgy of the Hours** (matins, vespers, compline)
- The **Rosary**, the **Angelus**
- **Friday fasts**, **Advent**, **Lent**

We’re not missing instruments — just the will to play them. The problem isn’t doctrine. It’s **distraction, dilution, and decadence**. We’ve grown soft. But the way back is already here.

## Has the Church betrayed the teachings of Jesus?

Yes and no.

There were – and still are – grievous abuses. Corruption, greed, manipulation, arrogance. The Church is not immune to sin; in fact, it often amplifies it through power.

But there’s a deeper lens:

> "The Church is not a museum for saints, but a hospital for sinners."

Or better yet:

> "The Church is a paradox — the divine Gospel flowing through human plumbing. Some of the pipes are rusted, some burst, but the water is still living."

And Jesus himself warned us:

> *"Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn."* (Matthew 13:30)

The weeds grow with the wheat. And sometimes, it’s only at the very end that the difference becomes clear.

## What is the most faithful path to Jesus?

It’s not a denomination.
It’s a way of being.
It’s becoming a **light**.

> *"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden."* (Matthew 5:14)

To live like Jesus:
- Love your enemies
- Forgive 70×7 times
- Seek the lost
- Feed the hungry
- Be poor in spirit, pure in heart, merciful
- Wash feet, not raise thrones

These aren't denominational behaviors — they’re **transformations of the soul**.

And yet… Catholicism, at its best, **equips** the soul to become that light. Through sacraments, ancient prayers, centuries of thought and mystical depth, it hands us tools — not all shiny, not all flawless, but real.

## On spiritual corruption and institutional sin

I used to be furious about the Church's hypocrisy. I still struggle with it. But then I noticed something deeper:

Even through corrupt clergy and institutional shadows, the light doesn’t vanish. Quiet people still kneel in pews. Candles still burn. Old women pray faithfully. Something sacred **survives**.

Maybe this is the paradox: the very ugliness of the Church **forces a deeper faith** — one that sees through the mess to the Messiah.

And as Pope John Paul II once wrote:
> *The Church is being purified — those who are here out of tradition are leaving. What remains is the faithful core.*

---

## From darkness, light

Evil doesn’t get the final word.

God is the master of turning crucifixion into resurrection.
Abuse into reform.
Disgust into discernment.
Collapse into clarity.

> If the Church is cracked — maybe it’s so that more light can pour through.

I don’t follow the Church because it’s perfect. I follow it because **even through all its imperfection**, I see Jesus.

I follow it because somehow, **grace still flows**.

> “If I look with the eyes of scandal, I see a mess. If I look with the eyes of the Spirit, I see mystery.”

And maybe that’s enough.

In this Holy Week — I don’t try to fix the Church.
I try to be one burning candle within it.

**Fiat lux.**

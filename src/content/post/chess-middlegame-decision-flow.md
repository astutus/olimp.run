## ♟️ Middlegame Decision Flow – OLIMP™ v3.0

A logic-based, tactical and strategic algorithm for consistent decision-making during the middlegame.

---

### 0. 🔍 Tactical Scan (You & Opponent)

- Mate?  
- Capture?  
- Threat? (something hanging)

**✅ If YES → act immediately**  
**❌ If NO → continue**

---

### 1. 📍 Evaluation

#### → Weaknesses (by priority):

1. King safety → mate / check threats?  
2. Queen exposure → capture threat?  
3. Key squares (back rank, mate square) → double attack?  
4. Unprotected pieces → double attack? skewer? fork?  
5. Weakly defended pieces → double attack? eliminating the defender?  
6. Pieces on same file/rank/diagonal → pin? skewer?

#### → Enemy’s Plan:
- What does he want in next 1–2 moves?

**✅ If clear → go to Candidate Moves**  
**❌ If not → continue**

---

### 2. 🎯 Strategy

- Position improvements  
- Exchanges (simplify / provoke / activate)  
- Pawn play (space, weaknesses, passed pawn, majority, chain leverage)  
- Prophylaxis & Restriction  
- Dynamic goals (attack, initiative, tempo)

**✅ If goal is clear → go to Candidate Moves**  
**❌ If not → play improving move (safe by default)**

---

### 3. 🛠 Candidate Moves – Execution

- Select 2–3 moves supporting your plan  
- Calculate only those  
- Choose & play the best one

---

### 🔁 Mantra

**Mate – Capture – Threat → Weakness – Enemy plan → Strategy → Move**

## ♟️ Middlegame Decision Flow – OLIMP™ v3.3

A clear, repeatable structure for middlegame thinking — born from hard games, analytical effort, and deep refinement.

---

### 0. ⚡ Critical Reactions

- **Mate?** – can I deliver mate? am I facing mate?  
- **Capture? / Hanging?** – can I take something for free? is anything hanging (mine or his)?

✅ If YES → act or calculate immediately  
❌ If NO → proceed to Evaluation

---

### 1. 📍 Evaluation

#### → Weaknesses (by priority):

1. King safety → mate / check threats?  
2. Queen exposure → capture threat?  
3. Key squares (back rank, mate square) → double attack?  
4. Threats? – is something (mine or his) exposed to trap, loss, or forced reaction?  
5. Unprotected pieces → double attack? skewer? fork?  
6. Weakly defended pieces → double attack? eliminating the defender?  
7. Pieces on same file/rank/diagonal → pin? skewer?

#### → Enemy’s Plan:
- What does he want in the next 1–2 moves?

#### → Reassess? (anti-tunnel vision)
- Position changed?  
- Outdated plan?

✅ If clear → go to Strategy  
❌ If not → continue

---

### 2. 🎯 Strategy

- Position improvements  
- Exchanges (simplify / provoke / activate)  
- Pawn play (space, weaknesses, passed pawn, majority, chain leverage)  
- Prophylaxis & Restriction  
- Dynamic goals (attack, initiative, tempo)

✅ If goal is clear → go to Candidate Moves  
❌ If not → play improving move (safe by default)

---

### 3. 🛠 Candidate Moves – Execution

- Select 2–3 moves supporting your plan  
- Calculate only those  
- Choose & play the best one

---

### 🔁 Mantra (v3.3)

**Mate – Capture – Hanging → Weakness – Enemy plan – Reassess → Strategy → Move**

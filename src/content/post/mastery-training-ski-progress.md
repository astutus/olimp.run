In 2022 I had a simple idea: take my daughter skiing.

It sounds innocent until you add two constraints:
1) skiing is an expensive trip (so you either learn fast, or you burn money slowly),
2) I wasn’t a skier — not in any meaningful sense.

I was 42. Two months before the trip I looked at the problem and concluded: if I want to be a parent who can actually *ski with a child* (not just stand near the slope like a decorative pine tree), I need a baseline level of fitness and coordination.

So I did what an engineer does when the system is underpowered: I increased capacity.
Daily micro-sessions. Push-ups, squats, sit-ups. Nothing fancy. Just building the “don’t die on day one” foundation.

## 2022: the first day that rewired the whole plan

We went to Białka Tatrzańska. Day one: I booked a 1-hour lesson with an instructor for my daughter. She was six and didn’t want to go alone, so I joined.

After the lesson we asked the instructors when we’d be able to ride the bigger slopes.
Their answer was realistic: *you’ll need practice, it takes time*.

I was ready to go back to the hotel. My daughter wasn’t.

“Where are you going?” she asked.
“Lesson is over.”
“Let’s stay.”

So we stayed.

We spent about two more hours on the bunny hill, then moved to a steeper one. Break. Then another session. Another hill. And by evening we were riding the longest and highest slope — the one we didn’t even consider in the morning as “possible for us.”

No elegance. No feeling of flow yet. But we were skiing.

That day contained the whole pattern:
- **instruction** gives you a map,
- **reps** give you a nervous system,
- **a curious child** gives you the courage to try the next slope before your adult brain votes “no”.

Garmin says 2022 was small in volume — **1.0 hour and 15.6 km** total — but psychologically it was the season that created momentum.

## 2023: from “we survive” to “we ski”

In 2023 everything was smoother.
We were skiing “as skiers”: most slopes, excluding the hardest red runs. We used the day fully — multiple sessions, every day. Not heroic. Just consistent.

Numbers (from Garmin): **4.4 hours, 77.3 km** across the season.
Average speed (Garmin’s `Avg Speed`) was around **16.8** with a top speed of **60.3**.

The key change wasn’t speed. It was **control**: less fear, fewer emergency-brakes, fewer moments where legs burn because you’re fighting gravity instead of working with it.

## 2024: the season that didn’t happen

Then 2024 failed completely.
My daughter got sick on arrival — very high fever — and after three days we went home.
The season was basically zero.

It’s a good reminder that training cycles are not “linear progression”.
Reality still exists, unfortunately.

## 2025: return and volume

In 2025 we came back hard.

Garmin: **23.7 hours and 122.0 km** of skiing.
That’s where the system started to look like a real program, not a hobby.

Interestingly, the average speed dropped (to ~**11.1**) while max speed stayed high (**58.0**).
That’s not “regression” — it’s what happens when you:
- spend more time doing technique,
- stop treating every run as a panic sprint,
- take breaks like a human, not like a machine.

## January 2026: next level — and actual fun

January 2026 is where the experience flipped.

We skied everywhere with full control. And we started doing the things that *force* progress:
- mornings in the snow park (small jumps, obstacles — beginner freestyle territory),
- playing on steep red runs, looping them for reps,
- skiing backwards,
- skiing in a tuck,
- and yes, hitting **70+ km/h** (Garmin shows a peak **73.0**).

This season is also the first time I noticed something very specific:
I wasn’t sweating from fear, and my legs didn’t hurt from braking.

That’s not “I got stronger”. That’s: the braking pattern got replaced by a better motor program.
Less wasted force. More efficiency. More composure.

Garmin summary for 2026: **28.3 hours, 137.4 km**.
Average speed around **9.8** with that **73.0** max — again: more time, more variety, more technique work, less “always fast”.

And that’s the point:
**mastery doesn’t look like constant speed. It looks like range.**
Range of slopes, range of movements, range of confidence.

## The hidden coach: a child’s curiosity

The funniest part is that the real driver was not my motivation.
It was my daughter’s curiosity.

She pulled me into the snow park. She pulled me into “try it” moments. I often didn’t *want* to do it — adult risk calculus kicks in — but I did it anyway because the training partner was small, persistent, and immune to my excuses.

## The adult advantage: a fitness base that compounds

The other driver was boring and predictable:
running, calisthenics, gym work, mobility.

That physical base paid dividends on the slope:
- more stability,
- less fatigue,
- fewer breaks needed,
- more days in a row without feeling wrecked.

I’m almost 46.
And I can honestly say this was the first ski trip where I felt like I was in the top slice of people on the slope — not because I’m a daredevil, but because I can ski with control and play.

Also: I did all of this while being heavily sick for two days.
Which is either a testament to training… or proof that I sometimes make questionable decisions. Possibly both.

## Closing

This started as “I want to take my kid skiing.”
It turned into a four-winter apprenticeship in deliberate practice.

And it’s one of the best trades I’ve ever made:
time + reps + health, converted into shared fun.

Because being fit is not about abs.
It’s about being able to say “yes” when your child wants to do something alive.

### Chapter 4 — My Take on "Copycats, Masters, and Makers"

This chapter hits differently. I see myself here — a future AI engineer, someone trying to navigate the waves of technology that keep getting more abstract and powerful. From simple Linux servers to virtual machines, then containerization and Kubernetes, and now\... AI. Possibly the most profound shift of all.

Kai-Fu Lee introduces four waves of AI. As in the previous chapter, I find the framing slightly artificial, but I get it — each wave builds on data, and the output of one wave becomes the input for the next. Still, this structure doesn't fully convince me.

**The first wave — internet AI** is about narrow AI that recommends and personalizes. The examples feel uninspired to me — YouTube, Amazon, Netflix. These are *simple* narrow AIs. But to be clear: narrow AI itself amazes me, especially large language models. It’s just that the first wave showcases a rather mundane subset.

**The second wave — "real" AI**, as I would put it, is where things get serious. Algorithms trained on structured data start showing actual intelligence. What fascinates me is how humans tend to draw conclusions from strong traits, while AI extracts correlations from *weak* ones. That’s a different mode of thinking altogether.

**The third wave — perception AI** felt less exciting at first, but I now realize it enables AI to step outside the screen and into the physical world. That’s the foundation of the offline revolution. Even if the tech doesn’t wow me, its implications are massive.

**The fourth wave — autonomous AI** is thrilling and terrifying. It excites me because it's a place where narrow AI already outperforms human "intelligence" in specialized domains. But it's also a wave that deeply worries me. I can see how many people could be replaced, with no real fallback jobs in sight. Massive social disruptions could follow.

I remember hearing about autonomous trucks in 2021 or 2022, especially Volvo's tests. I thought: this is just about regulations now — the tech works. And yes, I felt sorry for truck drivers. But I also thought I was safe. I was a highly-skilled IT engineer. Untouchable. But just a few years later, I realized: I’m replaceable too.

That moment changed something in me. It’s one of the reasons I’m diving so deep into AI right now — reading *AI Superpowers*, but also Melanie Mitchell’s *AI: A Guide for Thinking Humans*. I want to confront my assumptions.

### China Rising: From Copycats to Contributors

Kai-Fu Lee argues that China is no longer just imitating — it's innovating. I mostly agree. Chinese engineers were long seen as testers and polishers. But this is shifting. He shows numbers: Chinese researchers now account for almost half of AI conference publications. That says a lot.

Most of this momentum comes from applied innovation. China has more data related to the physical world: public surveillance, logistics, manufacturing. Meanwhile, the U.S. still dominates in finance, medicine, and deep tech.

As I noted earlier, Kai-Fu Lee seems emotionally closer to China, so he highlights its strengths. But the U.S. remains dominant in foundational research, elite universities like MIT and Stanford, and deeptech startups that awaken people like me to the reality that we’re entering a new era.

It’s also worth noting that AI progress doesn’t happen in isolation. It's not just engineering — it's culture, regulation, and politics.

### Students and Open Science

A small but important note: students today have an unfair advantage. They can access real-time breakthroughs through arXiv.org, GitHub, and open-source communities. It's worth remembering that access to knowledge has never been more democratized — and more overwhelming.

This chapter left a mark on me. It connects directly to my life and ambitions. I’m part of this transformation. And I'm trying to stay afloat, while knowing the tide is still rising.

title: Reborn Like a Fenix — How Garmin Changed My Life
description: I bought a Garmin Fenix thinking it was just a gadget. I didn’t know it would transform my health, awareness, and even habits like drinking.

In April 2017, at the age of 37, I bought a Garmin Fenix 5.  
A powerful gadget, no doubt — but also expensive enough to serve as a personal challenge: **“Time to move.”**

At the time, I had no idea this device would slowly, quietly reshape my health, habits, and even mindset.

## From Iron to Inertia

From 2003 to 2007, I was deep into weight training.  
Later came boxing, a bit more cardio, some 30–60 minute jogs at around 5:50/km pace. I started wanting to track those runs — to compare, improve, compete with myself.

I used phone apps like Sports Tracker and Endomondo. But by 2012, life changed.  
I was all-in on my career — working, learning, pushing. **80% work, 20% sleep**.  
Exercise disappeared.

## Enter the Fenix

By 2017, I realized: I needed something serious to get back on track.  
So I got a **Garmin Fenix 5** — flagship model, pro-level tool, and yes… pricey.

But that made it symbolic.  
If I bought such a powerful gadget, **I owed it to myself to use it**.

It worked. Just knowing I had that watch made me move.  
Also… my ultramarathoner friend had an old Suunto — I couldn’t just sit while wearing a better toy 😄

## Turns Out, I *Was* Training

Years later, someone casually asked if I worked out.  
I replied: _“Not really.”_

Then I looked at my Garmin Connect.  
**Over 1700 workouts** — walks, runs, short strength sessions.  
I was floored.

The watch had tricked me — in a good way.  
It turned movement into a **habit**. I’d created a routine without even knowing it.

## My Mistake: Going Too Hard, Too Soon

Unfortunately, I made a classic error.

I’d sit all day like a statue, then suddenly run 30 minutes all-out,  
on concrete, often in **HR Zone 4 or 5**, totally ignoring my joints and mobility.

The result?  
A meniscus injury that kept me from running for nearly **2 years**.

## But I Didn't Quit

I kept the Fenix on my wrist and promised myself:  
**This time, I’ll train smarter.**

That mindset shift is what led me to Garmin Coach.

## The Fenix 7 Era

By 2022, I was running more and needed more.

The Fenix 5 began to struggle — especially in forests, where GPS signal fluctuated wildly.  
One moment it showed me running at 12:00/km, the next at 4:00/km — even though my pace was steady.  
It was frustrating.

Also, I had more body awareness. My back was often stiff.  
I needed yoga, mobility, stretching.

So I upgraded to the **Fenix 7**, and it was like entering a new universe:

- ✅ **Multiband GPS** — finally accurate in the woods  
- ✅ **Preloaded workouts** — yoga, pilates, mobility, strength  
- ✅ **Truly reliable sleep and HRV tracking**  
- ✅ **Garmin gamification system** — levels, points, achievements

## Gamification — Used *Intentionally*

Now, some people mock the points system.  
But let me be clear: **I used it consciously, as a tool**.

Just like Charles Duhigg described in *The Power of Habit*, I created a **trigger → behavior → reward** loop.  
I knew that seeing those badges and points would push me to open up yoga or pilates.  
Without that structure? I would’ve never touched mobility in my life.

As a result:  
I'm now consistent. I do things that used to feel boring or unimportant.

That’s **real behavior change**.

## Sleep, Alcohol, and Facing the Truth

The Fenix 7 shocked me again with its **precise sleep and HRV analysis**.  
This wasn’t vague “wellness” nonsense — this was **real data**.

It caught every micro-wake, tracked REM, and showed me how I was really recovering.  
It even offered suggestions — how to improve my evening routine, how to get better rest.  
And I took it seriously, especially during a period when I was struggling badly with sleep.  
I adjusted, experimented, and — for the first time in my life — I started *really* caring about my sleep quality.

Then came the alcohol revelations.

All my life, people told me alcohol was bad. Killed brain cells, harmed the heart, wrecked sleep… but I never truly cared.  
Why would I? I felt fine two days later.

But now, with **Garmin showing me my own destroyed REM sleep**, **spiked resting HR**, and **crashed HRV** — I couldn’t deny it.

Even one big glass of wine had visible impact.  
And that did what no lecture ever could.

Since **March 2023**, I haven’t had a single drink.  
Not because I had to — but because **I saw the data, and I chose better.**

## The Comeback

Fast-forward to 2025.

- I run regularly  
- I train calisthenics and strength  
- I stretch and do mobility  
- I sleep well — and track it  
- I don’t drink  
- I feel physically **better at 45 than I did at 25**  
- And as a **side effect**, I lost **14 kg** (at one point even **18**) — without chasing weight loss.  
  (Frankly, I even prefer a rounder, fuller face 😄)

And while yes, I’ve reached **Level 6** on Garmin Connect with nearly **1000 points** — that’s not the flex.

The flex is: **those numbers reflect real change**.  
They show who I became.

## Final Word

One gadget. One shift in mindset.  
A second chance at long-term health.

**I was reborn like a Fenix from the ashes.**  
And this time — I’m staying in flight.

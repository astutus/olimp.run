## Summary

I’ve just wrapped up the **Garmin Coach 5K Time Goal plan** with Amy.  
It started strong, built beautifully, and ended exactly like my previous training cycles — in a **crash**.

I’ve seen this pattern **three times now**:
- The **Adaptive Training Plan** collapsed right after the peak ([final reflection](https://olimp.run/posts/garmin-coach-final-reflection/)).
- Another plan in **late 2024** ended with what felt like a victory — a few seconds faster, but paid for in exhaustion.
- And now, Amy’s 12-week plan peaked… then broke me again.

## The Peak

Weeks 11–12 were **the culmination** ([see the logs](https://olimp.run/notes/amy-mile-pr/)).  
A new **mile PR** and a near-perfect execution — but at a steep cost.  
Average HR for the final test: **187 bpm**, max **195 bpm**.  
Pace 4:18/km, cadence hovering around **170 spm** — still far from the efficient 180.

Yes, I set a record.  
But that “success” came wrapped in fatigue, elevated resting HR, and fading sleep scores.  
Sound familiar?

For almost **two years**, I’ve been circling around the same numbers — new 5K records by a few seconds, followed by recovery slumps.  
Different cycle, same outcome.  
It’s progress that *looks* like improvement, but feels like standing still.

## The Crash

Just like before, after the final peak the **system collapses**:  
HRV drops, recovery tanks, and what used to feel like Z2 becomes Z3.  
Once again I stretched the plan instead of **ending it right at the top** — and paid the price.

> “In 2024, I could run 5 K in 21:57 with an average HR of 187.  
> But I’d be wrecked.  
> My bloodwork would tank.  
> My sleep would collapse.  
> That wasn’t training — that was **damage disguised as discipline**.”

And here I am again. Déjà vu.

After these 12 weeks, I’m reading **Jack Daniels’ Running Formula**, and everything suddenly makes sense.  
Increasing intensity gives a strong early boost — fitness rises fast, but then the curve **flattens**.  
Meanwhile, the **setbacks curve** keeps climbing — slowly at first, then relentlessly.  
And that’s exactly what I’ve just experienced **empirically, again**.

## Lessons Learned

1. **The plan works — until it doesn’t.**  
   Twelve weeks is the physiological limit. Beyond that, the stress curve flips.

2. **Cadence is the bottleneck.**  
   Most of my runs sit around **150 spm**, even on race effort barely 170.  
   That’s too low for efficient leg turnover and probably why HR skyrockets under load.

3. **End the plan while you’re ahead.**  
   Stop at the peak, not after the crash.  
   Recovery is not optional — it’s part of the plan.

## Next Steps

Time for a **true deload**.  
I’ll focus on cadence drills, short strides, and rebuilding the nervous system before another cycle.  
This time, no “hero finish.” Just smart training.

**Déjà vu is a teacher.**  
I finally intend to listen.

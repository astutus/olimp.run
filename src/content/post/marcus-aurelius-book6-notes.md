**Book VI felt like a different league.**  
Less about repetition and discipline — more about essence.  
Below are the points that resonated most:

- **1. Reason never justifies wrongdoing.**  
  If you're truly thinking clearly, there's no path to evil through logic — only through distortion.

- **6. The highest defense is non-retaliation.**  
  No “eye for an eye.” A principle aligned with the teachings of Jesus:  
  *“Turn the other cheek.”* Power lies not in reacting, but in rising above.

- **13. Strip illusions.**  
  See through glamour and status. A fancy coat is “lamb's wool dyed in shellfish blood.”  
  The more you see clearly, the less you’re owned by appearances.

- **14. Everything changes. Everything flows.**  
  Sobering but honest.  
  Don’t build your identity on what’s temporary — even yourself.

- **21. Be ready to change your mind.**  
  Don’t cling to your views out of pride.  
  **Cling to truth — even if it means leaving your ego behind.**

- **27. Teach with kindness, not anger.**  
  Show others the better way. Don’t rob them of the chance to grow by confronting them with scorn.

- **36. Don’t “become Caesar.”**  
  Stay grounded. Even power doesn’t excuse arrogance.  
  Remain real, honest, decent.

- **40. Fulfill the will of the Creator.**  
  Just like a tool functions best when used as intended — so does a human soul.  
  This is the line that **hit hardest**.

### 🧭 A deeper question that won’t let go:

That single point — *living according to the will of the Creator* — opened a door I didn’t expect.  
It forced me to pause, and ask:  
> Not just *how* to live well,  
> but *why* I’m alive at all.

What is the purpose of my life?  
What was I created to be?

This question isn’t just stoic. It’s **spiritual**. And it led me to something older and more foundational:  
the teachings of the Bible.

There, I found that man was created:

- **To love God and others**, and in doing so fulfill the essence of life.
- **To multiply the talents** he was given — not to bury them.
- **To live in truth and humility**, reflecting the image of his Creator.
- **To be light** in the lives of others.

Not by dominance. Not by control. But by **truthful living**, presence, and character.

I’ve always wanted to give something real — to my daughter, to my people, to strangers.  
But this chapter showed me something deeper:

> **“I want to be exceptional, not for pride — but so the message of good becomes undeniable.  
True power comes from the one who has strength, and still chooses gentleness.”**

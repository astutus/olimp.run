**Book VI of *Meditations* felt like a shift in tone.**  
Less about discipline and repetition — more about essence.  
It reads like quiet, personal truths — not for others, but whispered to himself.

A few ideas struck me deeply.

Marcus reminds himself that **reason has no cause to do harm.**  
If you're truly thinking clearly, you can't arrive at injustice — it only happens when pride, fear, or confusion cloud the view.

He talks about **not retaliating** — not giving evil for evil — which felt powerful.  
It echoes the teachings of Jesus: *“Turn the other cheek.”*  
But here, it’s not religious. It’s solid, practical, and strong.  
Choosing not to retaliate is an act of strength.

His idea of **“stripping illusions”** also stuck with me — like calling a luxury robe “lamb’s wool dyed in shellfish blood.”  
He invites us to look at things not as they seem, but as they are.  
It’s a timeless lesson — don’t be hypnotized by surface.

Then there’s the moment he says: **“Be willing to change your mind when someone shows you better.”**  
That’s something I live by.  
I don’t attach myself to opinions. I attach myself to truth.

Several times he speaks of change, decay, impermanence —  
and while his tone is cool, I sense something tender behind it.  
It’s not detachment — it’s understanding.

He also says that **you shouldn’t get angry at those who are wrong** — instead, show them the better path.  
To rob someone of that chance with scorn is worse than their mistake.

And then a brilliant reminder to himself:  
> **Don’t “become Caesar.”**  
Don’t let status or power warp who you are. Stay real. Stay kind. Stay honest.

### But one thought stood out far above the rest — section 40.  

This line hit harder than anything so far.  
Marcus says that just as an object works best when it fulfills the will of its creator,  
**so should a human being live in harmony with the will of the one who made them.**

That hit me.

It made me stop reading.

It forced me to ask something much bigger than “How do I live?”  
It made me ask:

> **Why was I created?  
What is the will of the Creator for me?  
What is the purpose of life itself?**

And that question no longer belonged to Stoicism — it reached deeper.  
It led me to Scripture, to a different kind of clarity.

From the Bible, I saw that:

- We’re made in the image of God — to reflect His truth, love, freedom, and justice.
- We’re meant **to love God and love people** — and in doing so, fulfill the very reason we exist.
- We’re supposed to **develop the talents we’re given** — not bury them out of fear.
- We’re called to be **light** — not by preaching, but by living.

Not to possess, but to become.  
Not to dominate, but to embody truth.

I’ve always felt the urge to give something real — to my daughter, to my friends, to strangers.  
But this chapter helped me name it:

> **“I want to be exceptional, not for pride — but so the message of good becomes undeniable.  
> True power comes from the one who has strength, and still chooses gentleness.”**

## 🧠 A Shift in Thinking

2025 has been the first year I truly began to **train mądrze** — wisely. Not just run, not just follow plans, not just fight through discomfort. But think.

In past years (especially 2023–2024), I relied on **ambition, grit, and raw willpower**. My mentality was: *“Push harder. If it hurts, it means I’m doing something right.”* I chased personal bests with sheer force, thinking that high heart rate, suffering, and depletion were markers of growth.

And I got results. I broke records. But I also **burned out**, **damaged my recovery**, and **pushed my body past healthy limits**. I didn’t know how to train, only how to endure.

## 🏃 The Turning Point

This year, something clicked. I stopped worshipping the grind and started respecting physiology:

* I began watching **heart rate zones**, not just pace.
* I realized that **a good run isn’t always a hard one**.
* I finally understood that **zone 2 (base) training builds real endurance**, and threshold runs need precision.

I used to run “easy” runs at **HR 165+** and call it progress. Now, I run real base at **HR 145–150** and feel better, stronger, more stable.

Yes — in 2024, I could run 5K in 21:57 with an average HR of 187. But I’d be wrecked. My bloodwork would tank. My sleep would collapse. That wasn’t training — that was damage disguised as discipline.

Now? I’m still uncertain if I’ll break that record. But I’m certain that I’m **doing it the right way**.

## ⚙️ Training as a Tool

I don’t train to impress. I don’t train to collect medals. I train to build a **body that works** — a sharp, durable, responsive system that supports my life.

This means:

* **Mobility, recovery, and strength** matter.
* Training load is balanced by **training readiness**.
* My **central nervous system** gets a say, not just my ego.

Yes, the 17-week Garmin adaptive plan is brutal. But it has also forced me to **listen to my body**, to reflect daily, and to adapt even when the algorithm doesn’t.

Whether I beat my PR or not, I’ve already gained something more important:

> A mindset I’ll keep for the rest of my life.

## 🧩 The Bigger Picture

I used to think VO₂max was everything. Now I see it’s just a part of a **bigger ecosystem**:

* Sleep
* Nutrition
* Nervous system balance
* Emotional readiness
* Strength & mobility

And slowly, I’m learning how to align all these pieces.

This isn’t the end. It’s the beginning — of training with intelligence, not ego.

Fiat voluntas tua.

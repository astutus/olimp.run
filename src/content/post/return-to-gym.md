After **17 years**, I’m back in the gym.

Not because I suddenly “felt like it”.  
Not because I needed a new challenge.  
But because this autumn made one thing extremely clear:  
**If I want long-term performance, I must rebuild my system from the ground up.**

---

## Why now?

The last months were *super productive*, but **very demanding** — physically, cognitively, emotionally.  
I kept going because I have discipline, not because training felt good.

Eventually the signals became impossible to ignore:

- libido crashed almost completely  
- HRV became unstable  
- running intensity felt “wired”, not enjoyable  
- calisthenics felt mentally overwhelming  
- strength output dropped despite strong muscles  
- **and the breaking point:**  
  I started getting **brain fog triggered by physical effort** — something that had *never* happened to me before

These are classic signs of **HPA axis dysregulation** + **central nervous system fatigue**, not muscle fatigue.

## The investigation (6 months)

I checked everything — vitamins, minerals, bloodwork, inflammation markers.  
All clean.  
Most hormones also fine:

- total testosterone: good  
- SHBG: normal  
- estradiol: normal  
- prolactin: normal  

One thing didn’t make sense:

> **free testosterone kept sinking**,  
> and the **only marker consistently out of range was DHEA-S**.

I don’t even know my baseline DHEA-S, because I only started measuring it when things were already bad — but it has been **stuck in the low end of the range** for almost two years.

That was the missing piece.

## Why strength training?

Because I need a training style that:
- calms the nervous system  
- gives dopamine instead of stress  
- doesn’t spike cortisol  
- supports hormonal stability  
- rebuilds the HPA axis

Strength work with **Reps In Reserve (RIR) 5–7** is perfect for this.  
It lets me train **without touching the CNS ceiling**.

In contrast, calisthenics (especially Calimove-style 9×9 to failure) was **constantly murdering my CNS**.  
I had the muscles — but generating max neural output day after day finally caught up with me.

Strength training gives me the opposite: controlled, grounded, stable.

## The reset (Nov–Dec–Jan)

For the next three months:

- **2× full body strength per week**, strict RIR 5–7  
- **3× Zone 2 running**  
- no sprints  
- no intervals  
- no all-out calisthenics  
- sleep, DHA/EPA, creatine, KSM-66  
- keep the nervous system quiet, predictable, stable

This is a *rebuild block*, not a growth block.

## A note on regeneration

Two statements stayed with me this year:

**Ronnie Coleman (on Joe Rogan):**  
*“After competitions, I took three months completely off.  
My body needed it.”*

**Andrey Smaev:**  
talking about a period when his recovery collapsed, even on cycle —  
*“I tried everything to speed it up.  
It didn’t matter.  
My body started to die.”*

Both messages are the same:  
Your system is not infinite.  
If you don’t reset it, it resets you.

---

## Closing

It feels strange to write this, but true:  
Coming back to the gym after 17 years is not nostalgia.  
It’s strategy.

A deliberate reset.  
A rebuild of the nervous system, hormones, mitochondria, stability — everything.

For the first time in a long time, I feel grounded, clear, and on the right path.

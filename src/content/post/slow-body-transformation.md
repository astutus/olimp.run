title: A Slow Body Transformation That Changed Everything
description: I didn't plan to lose weight. I wasn't chasing aesthetics. But over time, consistency and small choices reshaped not just my body — but my entire life.

In 2021, I weighed 102 kg and had a 102 cm waist.  
But the numbers weren’t the main issue.  
The problem was that my body stopped being a tool — and started becoming a **limitation**.

I didn’t have a weight loss plan. I wasn’t taking pictures.  
I wasn’t thinking about “fitness.”  
At some point, I simply lost touch with myself. I was running on autopilot.

Then my health sent a warning signal.  
My back said: *"Stop."*  
And a thought popped into my mind:

> **"Do you really want to be a passive father?  
> The one who can’t keep up with his child?"**

I didn’t.

So I started moving. Slowly. No plan, just consistency.  
Over time — more often, and better.

In March 2023, after a hiking trip to Iceland, I quit alcohol.  
No drama — it just felt like the right time.

At the end of July 2023, I ordered a 2000 kcal meal plan from a catering company.  
I didn’t plan to lose weight. But I did.

The weight dropped fast — sometimes even a kilogram per month,  
though most of the time more steadily and healthily.  
I went lower than I ever expected. I reached 77 kg and 78 cm in the waist.

I didn’t even take any photos at the time — I honestly didn’t care.  
This wasn’t about announcing anything to the world.  
It was a process for myself, not for show.

At some point, I realized the weight was coming off too quickly,  
so I began increasing my calories — first to 2200 kcal,  
then occasionally snacking, eventually moving up to 2500 kcal.  
This was never meant to be a summer body —  
it was meant to be **a body for life**.  
A concept many people forget.

**Today, I weigh 81 kg and have an 82 cm waist.**  
That’s my current, realistic shape — and I’m happy with it.

And after 18 months, I finally let go of the meal catering.  
It served its purpose — it did the job.  
But I realized it’s not the healthiest long-term solution.

I care about the quality of ingredients.  
And catering companies need to cut costs somewhere — they have to profit.  
That’s why I went back to something I used years ago:  
a flexible nutrition system where I get the recipes but buy and cook myself.  
No vendor names here — just a method where I control everything.

More natural. More mindful.  
No salt if I don’t want it. No sugar. No “extras.”  
Just clean fuel.

And that’s when I noticed the transformation.  
While logging into my old account to reactivate the plan,  
I found the old photos I had sent for progress tracking.

I saw that old me.  
And I realized:  
**This wasn't just a change in body.  
It was a change in trajectory.**

*18 months apart. Quiet effort, visible change.*

Now I can — just for example — spend a whole day skiing with my kids,  
play football with them, race them…  
And I’m not that tired dad who needs to rest after 15 minutes.

I can even outlast my Belgian Malinois —  
so when it comes to kids, honestly… it’s not even a challenge 😄

This wasn’t the result of a quick fitness challenge.  
This was a **long journey**, built on **discipline, patience, and willpower**.  
It was never about showing off results — it was about changing how I live.

Now I have a body I treat as **a tool for experiencing life**.  
And I know that when your body is in bad shape,  
it clouds your mind, limits your energy,  
and dulls your ability to enjoy the present.

This change didn’t happen overnight.  
It wasn’t flashy.  
It was quiet.  
But it changed everything.

**Book IV feels personal.**  
Not just as a reader — but because I see something of myself in Aurelius.  
Not in stature or wisdom. But in attitude, and how he wrestles with the same tensions I do.

### Key reflections:

- **“The fire becomes stronger by consuming what’s thrown into it.”**  
  That’s how he describes the soul. Not as fragile — but as something that grows through challenge.  
  That image stayed with me.

- **He says people run to retreats — nature, villas, silence.**  
  But you can retreat into yourself anytime.  
  That struck a chord. I’ve always been like that — I don’t need the world to be peaceful.  
  I can adapt. Create structure. Focus. Even in chaos.

- **He talks about being forgotten — and accepting it.**  
  It’s more than intellectual detachment. It feels like a deep inner strength.  
  I understand what he means — but I don’t know if I *feel* it as fully as he does.  
  Maybe I’ll evolve toward that.

- **The decomposition of the body — back into soil, into atoms.**  
  He’s genuinely at peace with that.  
  And 2000 years ago, he already saw the cycle: **decay becomes nourishment**.  
  What’s fascinating is how natural — even beautiful — it seems to him.

- **"Remove the impression, and you remove the hurt."**  
  One of the strongest lines in the book.  
  It echoes Viktor Frankl: *between stimulus and response, there is space*.  
  That space is **freedom**. And responsibility.

- **He praises goodness again.**  
  The idea that living in accordance with the good is enough.  
  I wonder — did Christian ethics influence him? Or is this just parallel wisdom?

- **He emphasizes reason — again.**  
  But not just cold logic.  
  It’s reason *guided by virtue*. Without it, intellect can go dark.

- **He diminishes fame — completely.**  
  He says not even glory during life is worth much.  
  That cut deep. I still feel the pull of recognition, even if I know it’s hollow.  
  Aurelius was stronger. Or at least, more resolved.

- **Beauty is not external approval.**  
  Something is beautiful *in itself*. Not because people praise it.  
  That hit me hard. It reframes how I think about value — and validation.

- **He keeps returning to death — perhaps too often.**  
  It’s repetitive at times. But maybe that’s the point.  
  Maybe he’s not *preaching*, but *training himself* — repetition as reinforcement.

- **“Don’t focus on others — focus on yourself.”**  
  Pure stoicism — but also echoes Jesus: *“remove the plank from your own eye”*.  
  A universal truth.

- **Life is short. Prioritize.**  
  Over and over again — he reminds himself to focus on what matters.  
  That hit me hard. I often over-focus, hyper-zoom on one task.  
  But maybe, as he says, that’s not a flaw. Maybe it’s a gift.

- **Accept what must be — and don’t resist the inevitable.**  
  His words carry a strange peace — not passive, but grounded.

- **He praises justice. Then again, and again.**  
  It’s not justice as legality — but as fairness, dignity, and rightness in action.

- **On people’s opinions:**  
  *“What happens to you happens to everyone. But not everyone endures it with dignity.”*  
  That stuck with me. It’s not the event — it’s the posture.

- **And finally — he says something that feels like me:**  
  *If someone shows you a better argument, be willing to change your mind.*  
  I’ve always believed in that.  
  My beliefs aren’t possessions — they’re conclusions. If they stop fitting the truth, I let them go.  
  And in that — I feel close to Marcus.

**Takeaway from Book IV:**  
The soul is strong when it absorbs, not avoids.  
Life is short — and fame won’t matter.  
What you do, how you think, and whether you act in accordance with virtue — that’s what defines the quality of your time.  
And all else, in time, is forgotten.

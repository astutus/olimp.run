I often catch myself regretting something that feels oddly basic: I don’t really have anyone I can learn from directly.

Not because I’m some sort of genius. It’s mostly environment and access. In my day-to-day life I’m usually the person who *teaches*, explains, or solves things. And it’s hard to find people who are *clearly better*, who would challenge me, and with whom I could live in that “symbiosis” mode — mentor, peer, sparring partner.

So I end up extracting a lot from **LLMs**. If we’re strict about it: not “life experience,” but constant *nudges* about what’s worth paying attention to, what’s incoherent in my thinking, what I’m missing. Ironically, these models probably influence me more than most people around me.

Fortunately, I do have one human in this category: **Janusz**, my daughter’s godfather. He consistently shows up with something valuable — not random “bestsellers,” but things that *resonate* with where my head is.

Before Christmas he brought me **six books**. Three immediately grabbed me:

- *How to Live an Incredible Life* — **Anthony Pompliano**
- *The Great Mental Models* — **Shane Parrish**
- *The Principles of Economics* — **Saifedean Ammous**

I started reading the first two in parallel. And I got hit by a detail that made me stop and smile: **both Pompliano and Parrish wrote their books with their children in mind** — as a transmission of what they consider their most important wisdom.

That landed hard, because I’ve had the same motivation for years.

I’ve always felt this urge to build a repository of what I’ve learned — the things I wish I had been given earlier — so that my daughter can start from a different baseline. Not “spoiled.” Not “protected from reality.” Just… equipped. With the kind of ideas that compress years of trial-and-error into something she can actually use.

## Pompliano: a dense life, and a familiar philosophy

I finished Pompliano’s book first. It’s essentially a set of letters — **65 of them** — written to his kids.

The first thing that hit me wasn’t even a specific lesson. It was the *density* of his life: how much he did, saw, built, risked, and learned in a relatively short time. When I compare that tempo to myself, it’s hard not to think: *wow.*

But the more interesting part was watching how he thinks. And the funny (and comforting) part: I didn’t walk away with *tons* of new “revelations.”

Not because the book is shallow — but because in the last few years my own philosophy has converged with a lot of what he’s saying. It’s like reading a strong external confirmation that I’m not completely hallucinating my way through life.

## Where I strongly agreed

A lot of his “letters” mapped cleanly onto principles I already believe in — sometimes from my own experience, sometimes reinforced by people like Jim Rohn, Dale Carnegie, Fisher & Ury, Taleb, Marcus Aurelius, and modern habit literature.

Instead of rewriting all 65 letters (no one needs that), here’s the compressed set of themes that most resonated:

- **Treat today as training for tomorrow.** Your daily standards become your future reality.
- **Build a personal ethical code.** Not a slogan. A lived constraint system.
- **Be patient with mastery.** Real excellence is compounding, not fireworks.
- **Habits are strategy.** Not motivation. Not vibes. Systems.
- **Finish what you start.** “Potential” without completion is just intellectual décor.
- **Stop worshipping luck.** A lot of “luck” is positioning + repetition.
- **Read consistently.** Not for trivia — for long-lived models.
- **Compare up, not down.** The “worst-case comparison” is a drug.
- **Don’t fuse identity with role.** Job titles and social roles are temporary masks.
- **Power laws dominate outcomes.** Call it Pareto, 80/20, 95/5 — the shape is the point.
- **Own your schedule.** If you don’t, someone else will.
- **Respect time.** It’s the only currency you cannot earn back.
- **Don’t complain.** It signals helplessness and trains your brain into weakness.
- **Practice beats theory.** You don’t *know* anything until you can *do* it.
- **Simplicity is the final form of competence.** Complexity often hides confusion.
- **Avoid arguing with idiots online.** It’s negative ROI disguised as “debate.”
- **Be willing to change your mind.** Stubbornness is not strength; it’s fragility.
- **Invest in face-to-face.** Trust is built in bandwidth, not in text fragments.
- **Surround yourself with accumulators.** Builders, not drainers.

Some of these I learned explicitly (Carnegie’s “let people talk about themselves,” Fisher & Ury’s emphasis on direct communication, Taleb’s black swans). Some I learned painfully by getting it wrong and paying the bill.

## Where I disagreed (and why it matters)

There’s one theme I *do not* fully agree with — and it’s important enough to say it plainly.

Pompliano pushes the idea that you shouldn’t treat childhood as a burden or a limiting factor. The intention is good: don’t outsource your future to your past. Don’t use it as an excuse.

But here’s the uncomfortable reality: **childhood can be a massive, objective disadvantage.**

And not in some poetic “everyone has problems” way. In a literal “starting-line” way. Some people start the 100m sprint from 400m behind.

Pompliano’s kids are (very likely) going to grow up in an ideal environment. Which is great. But if you teach them a simplistic “childhood isn’t a factor” narrative, you risk producing something ugly: a moral lens where they judge others as weak or lazy — when those others were carrying a real burden, often invisible.

So yes: don’t let your past define you. But also: don’t pretend the distribution of starting conditions is fair. That’s not wisdom — that’s privilege with a motivational poster.

## Three ideas that genuinely upgraded my thinking

Even with strong overlap, there were a few points that sharpened things for me:

### 1) The Chinese Farmer story (attributed to Alan Watts)

The lesson is brutal in its simplicity: in the moment, you often cannot know whether an event is “good” or “bad.” Outcomes propagate. Second- and third-order effects dominate. We judge far too early, with far too little information.

I’ve seen this in real life: something that looked like a disaster later became a rescue; something that looked like a win later became a trap.

It’s also a useful correction to the instinct to blame God (or fate) immediately. Sometimes you’re simply too early in the causal chain to interpret anything correctly.

### 2) A Socratic lens on suffering

Paraphrasing the quote:

If everyone put their misfortunes into one pile and each person had to take an equal share, most would grab their own problems back and leave.

That matches my observation. People often imagine other lives as “easy.” But if they could actually *swap*, they’d hesitate. Many would prefer their own set of problems — because at least they know how to handle them.

### 3) A “content diet” as seriously as a food diet

Pompliano’s wife framed it simply: you guard your nutrition, but you don’t guard your inputs.

Why would you feed your brain junk every day and expect it to produce clarity?

Even if some news and “current events” are useful, most of it is short-lived noise. The better default is to build your mind on long-lived ideas: books, durable models, skills, principles — not outrage cycles.

This one is easy to forget in the moment, so I’m writing it here partly as a reminder to myself.

## Closing

Overall: solid book. It reinforced a lot of what I already believe, showed me a few things more cleanly, and gave me several mental handles I want to keep.

Next: I’m moving to **Shane Parrish** and *The Great Mental Models: Think Better, Live Better*.

## 🎓 Learning Mindset

Lately, I’ve been coming back to Jim Rohn a lot — especially this quote:

> “If you wish to be successful — study success.  
> If you wish to be happy — study happiness.  
> If you wish to be wealthy — study wealth.  
> Don’t leave it to chance, make it a study.  
> Some people just go through the day with their fingers crossed.  
> See, that won’t do it.  
> You’ve got to study the things that can change your life.”

That line hit me hard.  
If I want to **stay healthy** — and, as a result, run better — I should *study running success*, not just grind.  
It’s not about chasing records, but about training efficiently, wisely, and in a way that actually supports long-term health.

## 🧩 How Study Changed My Running Each Time

1. **When I couldn’t even run 1 km**, it was science and structure that helped me start.  
   That’s how [*Start Running for Beginners*](/posts/start-running-for-beginners/) was born — a story of how I learned to jog for 30 minutes without pain.

2. **When I spent two years stuck around 6:00/km pace**, I learned a different kind of lesson: training plans.  
   Following structured programs like [*Garmin Coach: 3-Year Journey*](/posts/garmin-coach-3y-journey/) finally broke my plateau — from over 30 minutes on 5K down to **22 minutes**.

3. **In 2025, I finally understood the importance of strict zone discipline.**  
   [*Training Maturity 2025*](/posts/training-maturity-2025/) marked a shift from “run fast whenever I feel good” to “train within physiological zones.”

4. Then came the **Amy Parkinson Time Goal Plan** targeting a 22-minute 5K — and with it, the hardest stretch yet.  
   Physically effective, yes — VO₂max skyrocketed — but I was wrecked.  
   Brain fog, HRV dropping, elevated resting HR, sore legs, Achilles on the edge.  
   I kept grinding like a soldier, pushing through 5×3-minute intervals at 188 bpm and ~4:00/km pace.  
   Then it escalated: 7×3 min… then 7×3:30 min.  
   My body started collapsing.  
   That was week 13 out of 15 when I realized something had to change — not in effort, but in **approach**.

## 💡 From Numbers to Understanding

My top priority has always been health and mental clarity.  
Running used to **refresh my brain**, not drain it.  
Dr. Terrence Sejnowski once said that research shows how running improves brain function — yet I was feeling the opposite.  
That contradiction hit me hard.

So I made a decision: to **study running scientifically**.  
I ordered *Jack Daniels’ Running Formula* — not to read it casually, but to master it.  
And to take things further, I bought the **Lactate Scout Sport** — to start measuring my blood lactate and make sure my training zones are *real*, not just Garmin’s color bands.

## ⚙️ The Limits of Garmin’s Algorithms

Garmin is great — it tracks HR and HRV beautifully, giving insight into cardiac and nervous system recovery.  
But it doesn’t tell you what your **legs and muscles** are going through.  
Its **LTHR estimate** is solid, but zone calculations are still based on **statistical models** built for the average athlete.  
And what if I’m an *outlier*?  
If my physiology deviates from the Gaussian curve — those default percentages fail.

That’s why I want to validate it.  
To check if “Z2 blue” on my watch truly means **<2 mmol/L**, and if pushing further actually helps — or silently harms.

## 🧠 Closing Thoughts

Jim Rohn said: *Don’t leave it to chance, make it a study.*  
That’s the path I’m on now — to study running the way I’ve studied everything else in life: deeply, deliberately, and with awareness.  
Not to win medals, but to train **efficiently, sustainably, and in harmony with the mind**.  
Because running should expand both body and brain — not exhaust one to feed the other.

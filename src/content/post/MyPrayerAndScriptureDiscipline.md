## Daily and Weekly Rhythm

A clear, steady practice — without pressure, without chaos.  
Step by step, moving toward God.

| Day           | Prayer                                | Scripture      | Deed | Reflection |
|:--------------|:--------------------------------------|:---------------|:-----|:-----------|
| Every day     | Morning prayer + Angelus (Anioł Pański) + Evening prayer | Psalm (Psalm) or NT (New Testament) | –   | –         |
| Once a week   | –                                    | –              | Yes | Yes       |

## Notes:

- **Prayer (Modlitwa):**  
  Morning: short personal prayer (2 minutes).  
  Noon: Angelus (Anioł Pański).  
  Evening: brief prayer or thanksgiving.

- **Scripture (Pismo):**  
  - Odd days: Psalm (Psalm).  
  - Even days: New Testament (Nowy Testament).

- **Action (Czyn):**  
  - Once a week: a conscious act of kindness, charity, or sacrifice.

- **Reflection (Refleksja):**  
  - Once a week: personal journaling — 5 minutes on what I learned, struggled with, or received.

**The goal:**  
To stay connected daily — through the Word, through prayer, through small deeds.  
Not to impress. Not to achieve.  
But simply to **walk**.

Fiat voluntas tua.  
(*Let Thy will be done.*)

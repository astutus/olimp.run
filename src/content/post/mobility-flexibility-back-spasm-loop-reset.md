title: "Mobility, Flexibility, and the Back-Spasm Loop: Reset"

On **26 October 2025** I made a decision:  
to take mobility and flexibility seriously — and do it *daily*, not “when I remember”.

I started with **Calisthenics Movement – Mobility 2.0**.  
The content is solid, but the sessions slowly expanded from **10 minutes to nearly 30**.  
That structure didn’t fit my day, and I couldn’t sustain it consistently.

So I switched to **GoWOD**, and honestly: it was exactly what I needed.

What worked extremely well:

- built-in progress measurement (and yes, I cared about the number)
- personalized routines
- three simple modes: **Daily**, **Activation**, **Recovery**
- I choose how much time I have (I usually picked **8 minutes**)
- I could do it anytime: during a work break, while cooking, between tasks

Because of that flexibility, it became a real habit.  
Over ~2 months I kept a strong streak and averaged **~12 minutes/day**.

And the results looked great:  
my GoWOD mobility score improved by **~17%**.

For a moment, it felt like I had finally cracked the code:  
a sustainable mobility system that fits my lifestyle and supports my training.

Then reality showed up. With a receipt.

## The “pancake” incident (18 Dec 2025)

On **18 December 2025** I did my usual session.  
During **pancake** and some hip “push-out” style drills, I felt something in my back. Not dramatic — just a warning.

The next day I went to the gym anyway (because of course I did):  
**Bulgarian split squats**, **Romanian deadlifts**, and **squats**.

That’s when it happened: a sharp shooting pain on the **right side** of my lower back, close to the spine — the classic “postrzał” feeling.

Two years ago I had a similar episode on the **left** (likely around **L5/S1**).  
This time it was the mirror version: **right side**.

The day after was brutal.  
Second day: even worse.  
Then it started to release — I could run again, walk, train — but something still felt “off” in the background.

## Round two (26 Dec 2025)

On **26 December 2025** I tried to “help it” in the morning with passive stretching:

- long-sit: legs straight forward, folding
- hip rotations
- more end-range work

Same story: irritation came back.

And here’s the uncomfortable pattern:  
two years ago, my worst back episode happened right after I massively improved my forward fold flexibility — then I did a twist while playing soccer and got the biggest back “shot” of my life. I could barely walk.

So this isn’t random bad luck. It’s a repeated script.

## What I learned (the hard way)

### 1) “More flexibility” is not automatically “more resilience”
I was treating increased range of motion like a pure upgrade.  
In practice, more end-range can also mean more opportunities to irritate tissue — especially if you combine:

- deep flexion (pancake / forward folds)
- rotation
- and then load it in the gym the next day

That trio is not a heroic mindset. It’s just physics.

### 2) Passive stretching can be a trap when something is already irritated
Passive end-range work felt like a “recovery tool”, but for my back it can act like gasoline on a small fire.

### 3) Mobility without stability is an incomplete system
The app optimized my flexibility.  
It did not guarantee that my spine and hips were prepared to *own* that range under load.

My mistake was assuming that a mobility routine automatically translates into safe movement quality in strength training.

## About GoWOD as a product

The app itself is good — the programming and UX fit my lifestyle better than structured follow-along videos.

But their customer support / subscription handling was disappointing.

I asked for two very reasonable things:

- a **blacklist** option for certain exercises (so the app never serves movements that irritate a known issue)
- a pause / a few weeks extension after the injury and forced downtime

The answer was essentially “no”.

So: solid tool, weak client approach.

## Where I go from here

I’m not quitting mobility work. I’m quitting the idea that mobility is always harmless.

From now on:

- less passive end-range flexion (especially pancake variants)
- no “let’s add rotation because why not” when the back is even slightly irritated
- more focus on **active mobility**, **core endurance**, and owning ranges under control
- and if something feels wrong: I don’t “stretch through it” to prove a point

Mobility is still a system I want in my life — just with guardrails.

Because the goal is not to win a flexibility score.  
The goal is to stay durable enough to train tomorrow.

## Not more, but deeper

While reading Book X, I had a moment of clarity.  
For the first time, I saw that **this journey isn’t about racing forward and collecting more wisdom**.  
It’s about **anchoring myself in the few truths that matter — and living by them daily.**  
That’s what Marcus keeps doing here: repeating, grounding, distilling.  
And I realize… maybe I’ve had a tendency to rush — *“OK, understood, what’s next?”* — when in fact, the power lies in staying.  
Reinforcing. Embodying. Living.

## Selected reflections from Book X

- **What happens has already happened.**  
  Marcus returns to his theme of eternal repetition. A calming idea — if it’s all been seen before, I don’t have to dramatize it.

- **Don’t squeal like a pig at the altar.**  
  Those who curse fate are like beasts unaware of what’s happening.  
  But reason lets us **meet fate with dignity** — not passivity, but conscious surrender.

- **Is death really that bad?**  
  Ask: if I lose this moment, this task, this person — is it truly worth fear?  
  If life is a gift, then letting go shouldn’t be a tragedy. Just a completion.

- **Look at yourself first.**  
  “What annoys you in others — do you do the same?”  
  Jesus said the same: the speck and the beam in the eye.  
  It’s a call to inner honesty.

- **The divine power of reason.**  
  Marcus lifts logos to near-sacred status:  
  > “With the help of a higher power, reason can overcome any obstacle.”  
  It’s not cold logic. It’s inner order that unlocks everything else.

- **Ask yourself first: What is your aim?**  
  Don’t just observe what others do — observe **why** they do it.  
  But begin with your own intent.  
  The clarity of your purpose is the compass of your soul.

In the end, Book X whispered instead of shouted.  
And in that quiet repetition, I found something truer than novelty:  
**A deeper self.**

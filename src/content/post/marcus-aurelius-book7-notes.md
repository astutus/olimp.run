**Book VII felt like the most fragmented so far.**  
There’s no single arc — just 75 short reflections, ideas, quotes from others, and loose strands of thought.  
Some were impenetrable. Some lacked soul.  
But a few stayed with me.

Marcus says:  
> *“What lies outside your mind has no power over your mind. Understand that, and you’ll be at peace.”*

It sounds obvious at first — but when I let it settle, I realized:  
That’s exactly what Viktor Frankl taught — that between stimulus and response, we have space.  
And that space is where our power lies.  
No one controls how I interpret what happens.  
That’s where peace is built — not in silence, but in sovereignty.

Another point that unsettled me:

> *“Among all these things — drama, fame, contests — stand firm in kindness and without contempt. Each person’s value matches the value of their pursuits.”*

That hit something raw.

Because I’m **not** like that.

I often *do* feel contempt — especially for people who pour their time and energy into creating trash, chasing clout, or glorifying nonsense.  
And yes, I judge them by their output. If you dedicate your life to garbage — how can I see you as anything else?

But Marcus suggests something wiser.  
He doesn’t say to admire them.  
He says — **don’t waste your calm on contempt.**

That maybe it’s better to show others — through example, not emotion — that there’s another way.  
Because reacting with disdain just breaks my own internal order.

Am I more active than him here? Probably.  
But is it worth the toll on peace? That’s something I’m still figuring out.

He returns to the idea that **help is okay.**  
If you can't do something alone — accept assistance.  
Stoicism isn't about isolation. It's about *agency*, not *ego*.

He also says that whatever happens in the future, the same reason you use now — the same clarity — will help you then.  
Simple. Reassuring. True.

There’s a strange moment where Marcus mentions **“one God.”**  
Which feels out of place in Rome — but it shows how the stoics were shifting from mythology to metaphysics.  
They didn’t believe in Zeus anymore — but in Logos, Reason, or some higher order.  
It was the beginning of a new spiritual seriousness.  
A stepping stone toward something more unified — and closer to what we now call God.

One line I underlined:

> *“Seek within yourself. The source of good is there — always capable of flowing again.”*

That made me pause.

Do all people have that source?

Or are some truly broken?

Are some people just… sadistic? Malevolent?

I don’t know.

But I like to believe that the source is there — sometimes buried, sometimes poisoned —  
but there.

And finally, Marcus quotes Epicurus, saying:  
> *“Pain is neither eternal nor unbearable — unless you enlarge it in your imagination.”*

That’s another timeless line.  
Suffering exists.  
But whether it **rules** me — that’s up to me.

Not a brilliant chapter.  
But still a few embers glowing in the dust.

And one day, I’ll gather all these sparks — and write a single post about everything *Meditations* taught me.

I didn’t read *Meditations* to become smarter.  
I read it to become **clearer**.

Twelve days. Twelve books. One ancient Roman.  
And, surprisingly, one very modern mirror.

### The Deepest Question: *Why am I here?*

It hit me hardest in Book VI, point 40 — when Marcus asked what it means for something to fulfill its purpose.  
A tool functions best when it’s used for what its creator designed it for.  

And so… what was **I** made for?

Not just *how* should I live — but *why* was I created?

That moment made me pause.  
Because I had always asked myself **how to live well**, but rarely had I dared to ask:  
> *What is the reason I exist at all?*

The answer began to form slowly:  
To do good.  
To multiply what’s been given to me.  
To walk near God.  
To serve others.  
To lead by example — to be a **light**.

### What I Learned About Myself

**1. Action is mine to choose. Always.**  
Between stimulus and reaction, there is a decision.  
Aurelius echoed what Viktor Frankl would later say nearly 2,000 years later —  
> *“Remove your judgment, and the harm is gone.”*  
I realized I don’t have to let events disturb me. *It’s my call.*

**2. I am a part of something vast. And small.**  
I was given a tiny portion of time — a speck of the infinite.  
No time to waste.  
No time to sleepwalk through life.  
I want to live, serve, act.

**3. I have goodness in me — and the will to grow it.**  
Over and over, Marcus spoke of kindness. Of forgiving others.  
Of meeting evil with understanding, not rage.  
It struck me:  
I *want* to be this man.  
Not to be admired — but to be **strong enough to be good**.

**4. I’m not finished yet.**  
Knowledge isn’t enough.  
It must become action.  
As I wrote in my own words:

> "From knowledge to action is the hardest road.  
> Many know they shouldn’t drink. Few stop.  
> Many know they should eat less. Few do.  
> And I — I know how I want to live.  
> Now I must **choose** to live that way."

### What Changed in Me

Something subtle shifted.  
I began to measure myself not just by strength or discipline — but by **inner alignment**.  
I started asking:  
- *Am I letting petty things enter my mind?*  
- *Am I judging others too quickly?*  
- *Am I living as if I could die today — and still be proud of my choices?*

The journey with Marcus wasn’t about collecting wisdom.  
It was about **removing what’s in the way** of it.

### Final Thought

I’ve read a lot of books.  
But few have demanded so much *honesty*.

Marcus didn’t give me new ideas.  
He gave me **permission** to become the man I already glimpsed inside myself.

> “Do not expect that bad people should not do bad things.  
> It is madness to think otherwise.”  
> — *Book XI, Rule 10*

He forgave the world. And held himself to a higher standard.  
That… I want to live like that.

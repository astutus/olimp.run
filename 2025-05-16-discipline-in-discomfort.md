title: Discipline in the Worst Conditions

On May 13th, I got sick. A full-blown cold — dripping nose, low energy.  
And yet… I still ran. I still trained.  
An hour of calisthenics outdoors — in the rain.

That’s not new.  
I once did a full 90-minute winter workout during a snowstorm —  
hands freezing, wind cutting through my jacket.

But what struck me is this:

**Discipline isn’t built on good days.  
It’s forged in the worst conditions.**

When I move through discomfort —  
when everything says *“skip it”* and I still show up —  
that’s when I grow stronger.

And it leaves a mark.  
A kind of silent confidence that says:  
**“You did this when it sucked —  
so you’ll fly when it’s easy.”**
